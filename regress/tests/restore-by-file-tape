# Run a simple backup of the Bacula build directory 
#   to a tape where the maximum tape file size is set to 1M
#   then restore a few files from it.  Note, by setting the maximum 
#   file size to 1M, it runs very slow. There are about 64 files that
#   are created during each of the two backups.
