  
Note: the patches listed here are not in their order of creation.

1.34.6-block.patch:
 In some cases, Bacula will get an error
 on a tape and not be able to write and EOF mark. In this
 case, the tape will no longer be readable. When this happens,
 Bacula tries to plunge on but gets into lots of trouble.
 This patch should fix that by immediately marking the Job
 in error, and by avoiding running through code that doesn't
 make any sense after a fatal error.

1.34.6-deadlock.patch:
 This patch fixes two problems: 1. A deadlock between the job
 queue scheduler and the watchdog thread. 2. A bad initialization
 of the watchdog queue which could cause memory corruption. It also
 reduces the watchdog granularity from 1 second to 10 seconds.

1.34.6-duration.patch:
 Patch to allow more natural input of time durations.
 Permitted form is "1 day 2 hours 5 sec" with and without
 spaces. The different duration specifications (day, hour, ...) 
 can be in any order.

1.34.6-find.patch:
 This patch fixes a problem where the Options are not properly passed
 from the last Option group to the NULL option group -- i.e. some of
 the files do not get the correct options.

1.34.6-gnome-console-Makefile.in.patch:
 This patch fixes an error in the Gnome 1.4 Makefile.

1.34.6-poll.patch:
 This patch fixes two bugs:
 1. It ignores an device open failure if polling.
 2. It disables the insanity check on reading the 
    tape label while polling. Normally the check
    doesn't allow the label to be read more than 100
    times.

1.34.6-pool.patch:
 This patch fixes a bug where Inc, Diff, and Full Pool overrides
 would incorrectly override a Pool= on the Run card. The patch
 also includes the Pool actually used in the Job Report.

1.34.6-resched.patch:
 This patch fixes two bugs in the job queue scheduling:
 1. It clears the SD status when rescheduling a job so that
    the correct status will be displayed by the Director.
 2. When starting a reschedule thread, it decrements the jcr
    use_count so that the job will not become a zombie.

1.34.6-slots.patch:
 This patch eliminates unwanted output (some 5000 lines) when doing
 an "update slots" command.

15Oct03
1.34.6-ACL.patch:
 This patch fixes a bug where the enable_acl=yes flag was not
 being properly received by the File daemon.
