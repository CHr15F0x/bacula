This patch add a column to the Version table of the catalog.
For example, bweb and brestore are using private tables, and
it is useful to store the schema version in the same table.

Product  |  Version
---------+---------
bacula   |    10
bweb     |    2
brestore |    3

instead of 

Version
-------
  10
