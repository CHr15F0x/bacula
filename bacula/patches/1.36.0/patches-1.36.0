25Oct04  1.36.0-sd-block.patch
 This patch will keep the SD from blocking simultaneous Jobs during
 a tape mount. 

30Oct04 1.36.0-verify.patch
 This patch fixes, at least partially, a Verify error where
 the count of files expected did not agree with the count 
 found. There are still some cases where the expected count
 exceeds the found probably due to the same directory being
 examined multiple times.

04Nov04 1.36.0-verify-2.patch
 This patch fixes the calculation for the total number of files
 to be restored or verified by not double counting files that are
 split across a tape file or across tapes.
 To apply this patch, you must first have applied 1.36.0-verify.patch.
  
10Nov04 1.36.0-jobid-restore.patch
 This patch fixes a restore to permit specifying both a JobId and
 a filename or list of files to be restored.  Apply to 1.36.0 with:

11Nov04 1.36.0-jobdefs.patch
 This patch fixes JobDefs so that if a Storage resource is
 specified in a Job, it is not overridden by the JobDefs.

13Nov04 1.36.0-list.patch
 This patch corrects a Bacula crash after a "list nextvol" followed
 by "list media". 

21Nov04 1.36.0-tree.patch
 This patch fixes (hopefully) a segment fault in restore when an
 empty path is found for a file.

21Nov04 1.36.0-autochanger.patch
 This patch should fix a problem where the autochanger thinks
 a Volume is in the current magazine and loops a few times then
 gives up.

24Nov04 1.36.0-autochanger2.patch
 This patch fixes an autochanger problem where Bacula was trying
 to access a Volume that was not in the autochanger. You *must*
 also apply patch 1.36.0-autochanger.patch for this patch to work
 correctly. This patch will probably also correct some problems 
 introduced with version 1.36 (dcrs) that make update slots
 fail.
