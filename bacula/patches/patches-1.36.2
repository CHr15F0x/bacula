 client (FD) where it edited nothing. With this fix, it should
 edit "since".

 This patch corrects a problem preventing multiple 
 simultaneous jobs from different pools.

09Mar05 1.36.2-win32-drive.patch
 This patch will prevent the Win32 FD from printing an error message
 when it attempts to restore the permissions for a drive (which Win32
 doesn't permit). The error is harmless in any case.

 on NetBSD. The patch was submitted by kardel with bug 258.

16Mar05 1.36.2-console.patch
 This patch causes the output directed to a file to be
 flushed after every line. This is a bit overkill, IMO, but
 a user complained about it.

17Mar05 1.36.2-restore-speed.patch
 This patch will fix a subtle bug that was introduced in 1.36.2
 which causes Bacula to be very slow restoring a few files. This
 is because it reads completely to the end of the Volume rather
 than stopping when all the files on the Volume are loaded. The
 introduction of the bug was caused by a patch that fixed 
 Bacula truncating tapes after a restore.
 Note that all source files will be rebuilt during the make.
   
18Mar05 1.36.2-store.patch
 This patch fails a job if no Storage resource is specified and
 the job attempts to call the SD.

18Mar05 1.36.2-reschedule.patch
 This patch should fix a Segfault bug when a job is rescheduled.
 The storage pointers were being released when they should not
 have been.
