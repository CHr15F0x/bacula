This directory contains patches to the *previous* released version
of Bacula. As they are developed, they will be put into this directory
so that they are all in one place, and you can easily find all
the patches that exist at a particular time.

When a new official version of Bacula is released (for example 1.36.0),
the patches for the previous release (for example 1.34) will be 
placed in a subdirectory, and patches for the new version will
go into the main directory.

The file "patches-version" (for example "patches-1.34.6") will 
contain a summary of each of the patches and when it was created,
so that you can easily see the order and the purpose of each patch.
Sometimes there may be dependencies between the patches -- i.e. a 
later patch needs a prior patch to be applied first. I'll try to
note those, but cannot guarantee it.


It contains also interesting/experimental patches from users. For examples,
 - SpoolSize defined per job (backup tunning)
 - fix for maxwaittime option
 - new maxschedruntime option
 - etc..

You can find them on testing sub-directory.
