 This patch should fix "update slots" with two different magazines
 in different pools by checking the pool when zapping the InChanger.

18Dec04 1.36.1-spool.patch
 This patch fixes the despooling size printed in the Job 
 report. Previously, it reported the total size for the
 device. This patch makes it report the size for the job.

 specifications. Previously they were not always honored.

 is a syntax error in its conf file during a reload command.

 in the incorrect name being used for the check.
 This could lead to security problems with unwanted 
 access by restricted consoles.

15Feb05 1.36.1-truncate.patch
 This patch fixes a bug where a tape gets "truncated" after
 doing a restore. The number of files in the catalog do not
 agree with what Bacula thinks is on tape, then the tape is
 marked in error.
