kes  Rewrite the set_jcr_job_status() code to include job status
     priorities so that more important status changes occur but
     lower priority status changes will not overwrite something
     more serious.  This could possibly cause reporting incorrect status
     reporting in some cases.  More testing is needed to ensure
     I have the right priorities. This vastly simplifies the previous

     different. This may lead to more deadlocks in the SD,
     but they should be resolved there.

     in the director.
kes  Don't print job report twice for failed VBackup jobs.
24Oct08
kes  Fix editing of retention time difference to use 64 bit
     int instead of 64 bit unsigned. This should permit very
     long retention periods.
kes  Implement code to prohibit a write job from appending to  a 
     Volume that will be used for a read operation.  This is
     new code and could possibly cause some conflicts.
23Oct08
kes  Integrate James Harper's Exchange Win32 plugin patch.
kes  Apply patch from Marco van Wieringen that implements the new
     Solaris libsec interface for ACLs so that Bacula can save and
     restore both the new ACLs and old ACLs.
kes  Marco's patch also corrects the file dependency generation code
     so that it works properly both with shared libraries and static
     libraries.
kes  Marco's patch also includes a small cleanup of the cats Makefile
     to remove some references to non-existent files.
22Oct08
kes  Modify win32 Makefiles to use full paths in most cases.
     In particular add MAINDIR environment variable that points
     to the main Bacula source directory.
21Oct08
kes  Add read volume list code to SD -- not yet used.
kes  Add James' binutils patch
kes  Split volume management code out of src/stored/reserve.c into

     a Volume not in the autochanger unless requested to do so.

     compiler guys have made a *very* bad change to their compiler.

     cast them, which is extremely ugly and ruins nice code as well
     as creates a lot of useless work.
02Jul08
kes  Fix mtx-changer to detect both versions of Ubuntu (Debian)
     mt. This fixes bug #1116.
kes  Add const in python files to reduce compiler warnings.

kes  Fix failure of 2drive-concurrent-test. Always read label;
     clear_unload() only after drive is defined in acquire_for_read().
27Jun08
kes  Generally clean up the manual tape loading code. The main
     conceptual change is that when a volume is marked to be unloaded,
     its volume name is retained, and it is only marked as unloaded
     when either the autoloader says it is unloaded or another tape
     is read on that drive.

     overrides are kept. This should fix bug #1094.

     work with StorageId to be able to use a particular drive in a 
     autochanger.

ebl  Update vtape driver.
08Jun08
ebl  Modify vtape driver to avoid sparse file.
