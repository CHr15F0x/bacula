              Technical notes on version 2.3

General:
20Sep07
ebl  Fix a command parser issue causing a director segfault.
kes  Fix ANSI tape labeling. Fix restoring ANSI labeled Volumes. 
     This fixes bug #954.
kes  Increase the max block size to 4MB fixes bug #957.
kes  ERABT if user sets min block size > max block size.  Fixes bug #956.
kes  Apply 2.2.4-poll-mount fix, that resolves bug #908 where a tape
     is not properly mounted (recognized) during a poll.
kes  Apply 2.2.4-verify patch that resolves bug #958.  A Verify catalog
     Job that has differences reports Verify OK.
ebl  Fixes #955 bug seg fault in Dir introduced  with regexwhere relocation.
17Sep07
ebl  Add an option to operate on all pools with update vol parameters.
     This complete the project 20. Patch from Nigel Stepp.
ebl  Add history support to bconsole when using readline.
     Using Ctrl-D to exit doesn't update .bconsole_history
kes  Modify new volume algorithm to use max MediaId for generating next
     volume number rather than the count of Volumes. This should essentially
     eliminate the failure rate if some volumes were deleted. Bug #921.
kes  Begin implemention of Optimize Job Scheduling.
kes  Implement restore callback that Dirk and I agreed on for bat 
     restore. This fixes bug #928. Restore of backup of zero files fails.
kes  Fix SQL Catalog logging which broke with new db_escape_string 
     calling sequence.
14Sep07
kes  Fix bacula_cats.def for new db_escape_string().
kes  Increase size of name string when FD making connection to SD.
     May fix bug #953. FD->SD connection failure.
13Sep07
kes  Add code to help Dan debug 2drive-incremental-2disk test.

     This fixes bug #950.
kes  Fix seg fault in error exit of acquire_for_read after unsuccessfully
     trying to switch drives by checking for blocking before unblocking.
     Fixes bug #906.
kes  Cancel storage daemon in all cases where FD reports error. This
     should fix virtually all cases of bug #920.
kes  Fix db_escape_string() for MySQL which did not compile.
12Sep07
kes  Fix error message that was clobbered when Dir tells SD it does not
     have write permission on Volume.  This should fix a minor point
     in bug #942, but not the main problem.
kes  Add code to cancel job in SD if FD connection fails. This should
     fix bug #920.
kes  Add code in FD exit to prevent loops and a crash on FreeBSD.
dvl  Pass jcr and db into db_escape_string() to enable better escaping
     of strings
kes  Fix migration code to get correct Volume name with multiple volumes 
     by skipping |.  Fixes bug #936.

16Aug07
kes  Fix configure to create bat Makefile before creating dependencies.
kes  Eliminate the egg files from the tray-monitor. Use gtk calls.

15Aug07
kes  Update AUTHORs file
kes  Increase the default max concurrent jobs to 20 in FD and SD to
     correspond with the default .conf files.

     Recycled volumes.
kes  Modify most of dird/msgchan.c to use bsock class calls rather than
     bnet calls -- no functionality change.
07Aug07 
kes  Modify the Verify output to specify if files are missing on    
     the Volume(s) or disk.  Fixes confusion in bug #916.
kes  When more than one Volume is read in a migration job, the last
     Volume bytes reported are from the last read volume rather than
     the last written volume. Fixed. This fixes bug #910.
kes  Fix display of Recycle flag after update volume=foo recycle=yes.
     It previously printed New Recyle flag is: no. This fixes bug
     #917.
06Aug07
kes  Correct seg fault when switching tape drives during restore.
kes  Commit uid_gid_name.c (replacement for idcache.c), but will not
     be used until after 2.2.0 release.

kes  Implement PopUp YES/NO dialog for bat.
23Jul07
ebl  Fix a compilation bug when using #define BACL_WANT_NUMERIC_IDS
22Jul07
kes  Correct RunScript to terminate job in FD on failure.
kes  Change abort_on_error and AbortJobOnError to fail_on_error

     marked as being removable and has the appropriate mount and unmount
     commands defined in the Device resource. This fixes bug #830.
kes  When applying a storage override, release all previous storage
     definitions rather than just prepending the new storage.
     This should prevent a good deal of confusion.
14Jul07
kes  Implement ./configure search for qwt libraries.
13Jul07

     Sergey Svishchev <svs@ropnet.ru> for the AIX platform.
kes  Make arguments to get_scratch_volume() in same order as other
     such calls.
kes  Rework the prune_volumes() subroutine so that after purging and
     no volume found in desired pool, it will check for a scratch 
     volume. This prevents recycling the whole scratch pool.
kes  Add code to status storage to print boffset_t (largefile support).
11Jul07
kes  Move qwt (Graphics libarary for Qt4) to depkgs.
kes  You now need a --with-qwt=<dir> to be able to build bat.

     bug in migration code where a job that spanned two volumes
     was migrated twice.
29Jun07
kes  Implement new BST_DESPOOLING blocked state. Change from locking
     during despooling in SD to blocking. This means that other threads
     can work with the device structure, in particular the reservations
     system while despooling.
28Jun07
kes  Fix return in reservation message queue that missed clearing
     the jcr lock (implemented 26Jun07 below).
kes  Rename a number of dev methods to make locking function names
     a bit clearer.

     out by Eric (my typo).
ebl  Fix configure.in to get batch mode enable
kes  Return correct string from authenticate.cpp in bat when connecting
     to Dir.
kes  Apply patch suggested by Frank Sweetser to fix bug #888 --     
     spurious line drops when using TLS.  
kes  Do not file reparse points when restoring a file that already
     exists -- Win32.
24Jun07
kes  Implement Windows reparse points -- similar to directories, but
     we do not descend into it. This is a first cut. They seem to 
     be backed up, but restore is not yet tested.
kes  Remove restore_blocking in tls code when shutting a socket to leave
     it in blocking mode. Hopefully this will fix the encryption bug  
     reported by Frank Sweetser.
kes  When opening a file for backup, tell the OS that we are going to
     read it sequentially -- optimization.
kes  Change variable names in authenticate_director() to not conflict
     with member names in bat. Caused great confusion with compiler,
     but no warnings.
23Jun07

     loaded tape but uses first drive).
kes  Fixed bug #807 Restore encrypted backup failed on Windows 2003
     This was indeed a Win32 issue.
19Jun07 
kes  Simplify search of autochanger for in-use Volume.  
kes  Fix exit condition of check for in-use volume.  kes Remove
     inappropriate my_postgresql_free_result() in db_close()
     routine.
kes  Fix bad return in FD when encryption signature not found.
     Probably caused a crash.
kes  Inhibit missing encryption signature error messages for 
     file types where no signature computed.
kes  Correct inverted check on autochanger in reservation system.
kes  Tweak debug code in autochanger reservation.
18Jun07
kes  Add some additional locking in the cats directory in subroutines
     that modify packet variables called from batch insert.
kes  Rework how dcrs are allocated. new_dcr() can now be called
     with an existing pointer, and it will simply clean it up.
     This allows the reservation system to test various different
     devices, and will permit easy device changes.
kes  A bunch of changes all over to handle new new_dcr() calling
     sequence.
kes  Work more on the Volume management in the SD. Remember Volumes
     for tape drives and for autochangers (even virtual disk changers).
kes  When looking at the Volume list to reserve a drive, handle 
     autochanger names correctly by interating through the changer 
     devices.  Also call the Director to see if a Volume is suitable
     for the current job.
kes  Fix some bugs in bscan. Make sure all media records are written.
     Make sure that valid JobMedia records are written for disk files.
     Previously they were completely wrong.
kes  Move source tar files for depkgs-mingw32 to www.bacula.org so
     that the URLs don't change and so that the developers will all
     work off the same copy. Rebuild from scrach.
kes  Upgrade Win32 SQLite3 from 3.3.8 to 3.3.17.

Release: 2.1.18 beta
16Jun07
kes  Fix seg fault in FD from incorrect digest size. 
kes  Fix argument to non-OpenSSL crypto.c subroutine.      

Release: 2.1.16 beta
16Jun07
kes  Remove a few malloc()s from the encryption code.
kes  Use the class calls to bsock in filed/backup.c and restore.c in
     place of the old bnet_xxx code.
kes  Implement code that does an on the fly calculation of the  
     signing digest during restore of encrypted files.  It makes
     a best guess at the algorithm, and if it is not correct, will
     then revert to the old code which reads the file after it is
     restored.
kes  Implement at least one missing crypto stream in stream_to_ascii()
kes  Apply patch from William <chowmeined@gmail.com> that fixes bug
     #877 where a reload with bad syntax causes Dir to exit.

Cut: 2.1.14 beta (not released)
14Jun07
kes  Do not free a volume on a tape drive until another volume is
     mounted and read, or the autochanger unloads the volume.
     This should help the SD re-use volumes that are already mounted,
     and should fix bug #886.
kes  Apply patch from user brettedgar that allows gnome2-console include
     the OpenSSL libraries, and hence work with SSL.  Fixes bug #885.
kes  Apply patch from Lucien Weller that fixes day of week calculation
     because of DST flag problem. Fixes bug #887.
10Jun07
kes  Move find_next_appendable_volume() to after acquiring a valid device
     in reserve.c.  This fixes bug #864 -- confirmed by reporter.
09Jun07
kes  Unable to reproduce bug 872. However added additional testing for
     integer.
kes  Bug #874 resolved by documenting SQLite limitations.
kes  Bug #882 resolved by documenting mtx-changer script for new drive code.
kes  Bug #881 resolved by removing typo in mtx-changer script.
kes  Made Frank Sweetser's wiki the official Bacula wiki with his
     approval. Added a link to the wiki on the web page, and implemented
     a backup from http://paramount.ind.wpi.edu                                          
08Jun07

kes  Fix sscanf problems reported by Peter Buschman that caused
     a bus error on Solaris.
kes  Rework (simplify) the select prompt in bat.
kes  Move get_jobid_from_tid() into lib and create a 
     get_jcr_from_tid().
kes  Use get_jcr_from_tid() to conver all tls Emsg() to Jmsg().  This
     should definitely fix the problem of lost error messages in the
     encryption code.
kes  Remove over zellous addition of FSFE copyright in a few eggxxx files.
kes  Eliminate tcpd.h from the project. Enclose the #include from the
     library with extern C ...

03Jun07
kes  Implement SQLITE3_INIT_QUERY in version.h that can do an initial
     query for SQLite3. Use it to set PRAGMA synchronous = OFF. This
     makes SQLit3 run 30 times faster, though a bit less safe.
kes  Implement --with-batch-insert in configure and detection of thread
     safe libraries.  It is on by default, but turned off if no thread
     safe library (e.g. SQLite 2) is available.
02Jun07
kes  Fix Bacula PostgreSQL buffer overruns.
kes  Do better checking for NULL results returned from PostgreSQL;
     implement retry for failed queries; clear results buffer after
     failed query. Hopefully this will correct the PostgreSQL failures.
01Jun07

     Prefer Mounted Volumes = no.
kes  Fix a Bacula PostgreSQL bug dereferencing a NULL pointer      
     returned from a query.

kes  Update the win32/dll/bacula.defs file.
29May07
kes  Tweak reservations algorithm to permit a few more cases, i.e.
     volume reserved, but on different drive, ...

     to avoid confusion with Orphaned buffers.
kes  I reworked the OpenSSL include/lib flags to be handled in     
     the standard Bacula way, which should fix bug #863 concerning
     non-standard OpenSSL libraries.

kes  Fix reload bug that reset StorageId to zero.
25May07
kes  Fix TLS #ifdefing when TLS turned off.
kes  Ensure that when labelling a tape with Slot=0 that InChanger
     is not set.
kes  Use DISTINCT to make MySQL and PostgreSQL uar_list_temp query        
     the same.
kes  Add StartTime to final uar_sel_jobid_temp query so that we can
     add DISTINCT (required by PostgreSQL).
kes  Implement BSOCK authenticate_director() method. Eventually will
     authenicate all daemons.
kes  Move several more functions into the BSOCK class.
24May07
kes  Add code to tell the OS that we no longer need a cached
     file that we were reading. In findlib/bfile.c.  Also,

     Tobias Oetiker <tobi@oetiker.ch> for the idea.
kes  Tweak to bsmtp to eliminate compiler warnings on Win32.
kes  Implement script to automatically generate cats and dll .def
     files for Win32 dll.

kes  Some time in March, a Feature Request with patch from Jorj Bauer
     <jorj@seas.upenn.edu> was committed by Landon (with my approval).
     It implements:
     The ability for the director to validate a Client (FD) CN against
     an arbitrary set of patterns rather than the hostname, with
     A new 'TLS Allowed CN' set of directives which are implemented
     in the Client resource.  Then pattern matching is used in place
     of hostname matching against the Certificate's CN. As an example, we
     have certificates which (a) use a local CA, and (b) have a CN of the
     form client_123.

     previous change (probably the recent TLS patch).
23Mar07
kes  Write new subroutine is_volume_purged() that explicitly checks
     if the Volume is purged, and if so marks it as such. This should
     resolve problems reported about needing to mount twice to recycle
     volumes.
kes  Rewrite pruning algorithm to do more work in the SQL engine, and
     to pass a list of JobIds to be deleted to SQL.  Also, minimize the
     amount of duplicated code.     
kes  Do volume pruning only for the Media Type desired (reduces pruning time
     if multiple Media Types are in the same pool).
kes  Implement more detailed info in the Job report for the Bacula version
     and architecture.

kes  Correct how the new batch insert db_create_attributes_record()
     uses the arguments.  Caused a seg fault in bscan.
kes  Implement lock() and unlock() methods in DEVICE class.
     Implement block() and set_block(xx) methods in DEVICE class.
kes  Modify bnet_connect() so that it uses time() to check for the
     wait time expiring (on some OSes, some system calls may not
     return immediately).
kes  Modify Verify to obtain the previous JobId when it is actually
     running rather than at schedule time (as it was in 1.38.x).     
kes  Fix src/job.c to handle MaxWaitTime correctly.  This should
     fix bug #802.

kes  Apply patch from bug #612 by Rudolf Cejka to speedup pruning
     in the case of orphaned records.
kes  Modify dbcheck to handle orphaned JobMedia, Path, Filename,
     and File records in 300K chunks to be more efficient. This
     idea came from Juan Luis Frances (if I remember right).
kes  Apply Eric's scratch patch that moves a purged Volume to
     the RecyclePool.  Question: how is RecyclePool set? what
     happens to the ScratchPool?
kes  Apply Eric's media patch that collects read/write media
     times as well as byte counts.  This patch requires a
     simultaneous upgrade of the DIR and SD.  Note, there
     should be some way to turn off timing. I'm not sure
     times are in Bacula units.
kes  Apply Eric's batch-insert patch.
09Feb07
kes  Update projects list.
08Feb07
kes  Implement Include/Exclude file lists in FD as dlists using

     console is authorized to cancel the job.  This fixes bug 
     #767.

     to use dlist (for large include/exclude lists).
kes  Fix a bug in the btree.c and btree.h routines, then rename them
     rblist and add them to be built in src/lib.  Include some new
     methods written by Rudolf Cejka that make the code more readable
     (hides some of the ugly casting).
kes  Add set_next() and set_prev() methods which make the code much more 
     readable. Also add a new dlistString class that facilitates storing
     strings in dlists.  To be used in the large include/exclude lists.
kes  Make some trivial modifications to lib/tree.h that use rblist
     rather than dlist for storing the tree links. This was suggested
     by Rudolf Cejka.  The result of this is that the restore tree now
     uses red-black binary trees rather than simple linked lists. This
     should give rather dramatic speed improvements for directories
     contining large numbers of directories/files (more than 10000).
