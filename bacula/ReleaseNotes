For Packagers:
1.  The default query.sql file is now, except for some comments, empty.
The old file, which we no longer support (it is impossible or difficult to
make it work on every backend, and the queries are mostly contributed) can
be found in <bacula-source>/examples/sample-query.sql.  The sample file is
not installed by the Makefiles

2.  When you install the mtx-changer script, you must also install
mtx-changer.conf if it does not exist.  This new file (mtx-changer.conf) is
required for mtx-changer to work, but it is a user configurable file, so on
any update, any existing file should not be overwritten.

3.  Bat should be built on every platform that is capabable of running Qt.
However, the Qt code is changing rather quickly and is not always
compatible from version to version.  We have built and verified bat on Qt
4.3.4.  We strongly recommend that you do not build and distribute bat with
any other version of Qt unless you personally test it.  To build against Qt
4.3.4, download the depkgs-qt package from the Bacula Source Forge download
location, read the README file and follow the instructions.

If you are building for Bacula version 5.0.0, please ensure that you do not
have qmake-qt4 loaded on your system.  If you do, either remove it or
rename it before trying to build bat.  If you do not, bat will probably be
built using the shared objects on your system.  For Bacula 5.0.1 and later,
this problem (bug) does not exist.

depkgs-qt does not install Qt on your system, nor does it interfere with
you having any other version of Qt installed on your system.  Once you
build bat with depkgs-qt, it should *not* use the Qt shared objects, but
rather they will be linked into the program.  After fully installing bat
(make install), you can run "ldd bat" to see what shared objects it will
use.  If any Qt shared objects are referenced, something has gone wrong.

4.  Unless absolutely necessary, we recommend that you do not define any
special library environment variables that apply to the ./configure -- for
example: LIBDIR=/...  ./configure <your-options> is strongly discouraged.
Doing so, could potentially cause Bacula to be linked against the wrong
shared objects.

5.  The Bacula project strongly recommends that you install Bacula into a
single directory, with a few minor exceptions such as the MySQL or
PostgreSQL databases.  Preferrably this should be /opt/bacula.  The full
recommendation is:

#!/bin/sh
# Recommended configure script for Bacula
prefix=/opt/bacula
email=xxx@yyy.zz
CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall" \
  ./configure \
    --sbindir=${prefix}/bin \
    --sysconfdir=${prefix}/etc \
    --docdir=${prefix}/html \
    --htmldir=${prefix}/html \
    --with-working-dir=${prefix}/working \
    --with-pid-dir=${prefix}/working \
    --with-subsys-dir=${prefix}/working \
    --with-scriptdir=${prefix}/scripts \
    --with-plugindir=${prefix}/plugins \
    --libdir=${prefix}/lib \
    --enable-smartalloc \
    --enable-tray-monitor \
    --enable-bat \
    --with-mysql \
    --with-dump-email=${email} \
    --with-job-email=${email} \
    --with-smtp-host=localhost \
    --with-baseport=9101

Obviously, the email, and some of the minor options (mysql, postgresql,
...) can be changed to suit your distribution, but the directory names
defined above are strongly recommended, and over time the default values in
the bacula-dir.conf and bacula-sd.conf will reflect these choices.

If you have any questions about this or would like a detailed document
describing our recommendations including packaging requirements, please
send an email to the bacula-devel list.

6.  Starting with Bacula version 3.0.0 up to Bacula 5.0.0, the shared
libraries that Bacula uses by default are named xxx-1.0.0.  Starting with
Bacula 5.0.1, we are going to name the libraries using the Bacula version.
So in Bacula 5.0.1, the libraries will be named xxx-5.0.1.  With future
versions, the last digit may or may not change when we distribute patch
updates (i.e.  the last digit of the version changes).  This will depend on
whether or not we have changed something in the library.  Hopefully this
new procedure will resolve some of the incompatibility problems between
different versions of the shared objects.

7.  The default build option for bconsole is conio (my own little console
routines).  I did this because some years ago, readline was very difficult
to maintain -- it and where it was found seemed to change on every release.
This generated at the time a number of support problems.  It seems to me
that since then there have been very few problems with readline.  As a
consequence, I have no problem if you want to make bconsole with readline
enabled.  It will actually give some very nice new bconsole command
completion functionality that Eric has written.  Bottom line: feel free to
use readline or not as you please.

Release Notes for Bacula 5.0.0

Release Numbering:
-----------------------------------------------------------
You might be wondering why this release jumps from 3.0.x to 
5.0.0 thus skipping version 4.0.0.  We have done this for 
several reasons: first, we wanted a way of distinguishing
the numbering system for the Bacula System Enterprise version
and the Bacula Project version.  So, to do so, we have decided
that the first number of the Bacula Project version will always
be odd, and the first number of the Enterprise version will always
be even. Thus the Bacula Project now moves from 3.0.x to 5.0.x.
In addition, we want to keep the Bacula Project version larger
than the Enterprise version to indicate that the Bacula Project
version is more advanced or has more features than the 
Enterprise version. For memory, the current Enterprise version
is 2.6.1, and the next release (in a few months -- before June 2010)
will be version 4.0.0.

Warning:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Please note the three Warnings below before doing any install or
upgrade.
       

Changes since 3.0.3a (the last Bacula Project release):

Compatibility:
As always, both the Director and Storage daemon must be upgraded at
the same time, and on any given machine, you must run only one version
of Bacula. This means that on the Director and Storage daemon machines,
you *must* upgrade your File daemon as well.

Older 3.0.x and possibly 2.4.x File Daemons are compatible with the 5.0.0
Director and Storage daemons. There should be no need to upgrade older File
Daemons immediately. However, we recommend that you do so as soon
as is reasonable for your situation.

================== Warning !!!!!! ==========================

New Catalog format in version 5.0.0 (3.1.9 or later)
-----------------------------------------------------

This release of Bacula uses a new catalog format. We provide a set of
scripts that permit to convert a 3.0.x (version 11) catalog to 5.0.0 (version
12).  The Bacula project rpms distributed on Source Forge will automatically
detect the database change and do the upgrade for you.  We strongly
recommend that you save a copy of your existing database before upgrading
using rpms.

The simplest way to upgrade the database assuming you are building from
source:
1. Stop any current version of Bacula from running.
2. Save a copy of your existing database.
3. Configure, build, and install the 5.0.0 version of Bacula
   Note the new ./configure options in the manuals see the link
   at the bottom of this file.
4. cd <your-scripts-installation-directory>
5. ./update_bacula_tables
6. If you have multiple catalogs, edit the update_bacula_tables
   script and put the name of another database, and then
   execute the script again. Repeat this until all Bacula
   catalogs have been updated.
7. Start the new Bacula.  If everything worked, it should
   not print any error messages.

If you start from scratch, you don't need to run the update_bacula_tables
script because the create_bacula_tables script automatically creates the new
table format.  However, if you are using a version of Bacula older than 3.1.9
(e.g.  3.0.3) then you need to run the update_bacula_tables script that will
be found in the <bacula>/src/cats directory after you run the ./configure
command.  As mentioned above, before running this script, please backup your
catalog database, and when you do running it, be sure shutdown Bacula and be
aware that running the script can take some time depending on your database
size.
================================================================


================== Warning !!!!!! ==========================
If you upgrade a previous Win32 client installation, you must
first stop the File daemon, then uninstall it before attempting
the upgrade. If you do not do so, the upgrade will probably
fail and you will need to manually find and run the 
Uninstall.exe file, before you can upgrade to the new version.
This is because the file locations are different.  If you want
to save your previous bacula-fd.conf file, please do so before
uninstalling it.
================================================================

================== Warning !!!!!! ==========================
Due to permissions problems on Windows Vista and later systems,
we no longer require SYSTEM or Administrator permissions to 
access the binaries and configuation files.  If you wish
to restrict access to these files, please see the New Features
section of the manual for how to set access control lists.
================================================================

Note, the Win32 Installer no longer installs the Bacula Servers
(Director and Storage daemon). See the New Features section of
the manual for more details.

============ Documentation improvements needed ==================

Note!!!!! The 5.0.0+ documentation has a number of known problems:

1. We have reduced the number of manuals, which has fixed many
   of the broken links found in the old 3.0.x version, but there
   are still some that need fixing.

2. Integration of the 3.0.x features into the main manuals has
   not yet been done.

The documentation will not be completed in the near future due to lack
manpower.  If you are unhappy with this situation as we are, we suggest
you help by submitting patches to the documentation.  Thanks.
=====


This release includes large number of new features and changes.
It should be more or less compatible with previous xx.conf files
and File daemons providing that you are not using any of the new
features.

Please see the New Features chapter of the new manual, which documents
some but not all the new features (we are still working on it):
