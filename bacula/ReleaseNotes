          Release Notes for Bacula 1.31

  Bacula code: Total files = 251 Total lines = 74,714 (*.h *.c *.in)

Major Changes this Release:
- The database format has changed. Please see below.
- Support to save and restore all files on WinNT/2K/XP systems 
  including the permissions. Unfortunately files that are in use by another
  program cannot be saved.
- Support for Win95 systems (untested since I don't have Win95).
- Heartbeat every 20 minutes between daemons to prevent network
  timeouts. The heartbeat interval can be set.
- Volume names may now only contain letters, numbers, colon, period, dash,
  and underscore.
- Added readline to depkgs (removed from depkgs1) and fixed configuration if
  it is not installed in your system libraries.
- Implemented generalized tape label formats including counter variables 
  for automatic naming of Volumes.
- Multiple simultaneous jobs now work.
- Implemented tape block rejection, which means that restores with
  several incremental backups will run orders of magnitude faster.


Other Changes this Release:
- Restore checks block numbers to ensure that no block is lost.
- The new console var command allows testing variable expansion
  used in automatic tape name generation.
- The new console estimate command allows you to test FileSets
  to see how many files and bytes will be saved and optionally
  to have an "ls -l" style listing of the files.
- During a normal restore (replace = yes), any existing file is deleted
  and the restored file is then created. This corrects links and other
  wierd files that changed between the backup and the restore.
- Preliminary support for BSDi.
- Use smtp instead of mail to send the traceback message.
- Fixed a race condition in the "list" command while a backup is
  in progress.
- Beginning of support for SSL encryption.
- Beggining of support for Base level backups.
- Improvements to gnome-console.
- Prune orphaned jobs (no files saved, no Volume used).
- Added non-fatal errors to Job reports.
- Eliminate need for SubsysDirectory in each daemon -- please remove
  these records from your .conf files.
- Add a lot more "command line" options to console commands.
- More info in traceback (database type, ...).
- Better handling of errors with autochangers during restore.
- Better cancellation of jobs in Storage daemon (doesn't try
  to cleanup twice).
- Better cancellation of File daemon (except on Cygwin systems).
- SD error messages such as autochanger errors are now properly
  directed back to Console -- previously some were lost.
- A Storage daemon crash on FreeBSD systems (due to a different FreeBSD
  pthreads implementation) is fixed.
- Better Job termination report particularly for Verify and Restore jobs.
- Update Verify VolumeToCatalog to use new BSR records.
- Fixed list last 20 jobs in restore command (previously reported any 
  20 jobs).
- Gnome command line history works better.
- Better messages if a job is upgraded from Diff or Inc to Full.
- Replaced FileSet MD5 with date created -- more aestetic and readable.
- Fixed a FD crash on long directory names (Win32 specific).



Items to note:  !!!!!
- The default time interval is now days instead of seconds. Please
  check your .conf files!
- For MySQL users, you must have the thread safe client libraries 
  available.  If you build MySQL yourself, add the --enable-thread-safe-client
  option on the ./configure.  You will most likely need to do an ldconfig.
  Please see the installation documentation for building MySQL.
- Version 1.31 and 1.30 daemons/Director are not compatible. You must
  upgrade all or nothing.
- The format of the catalog database has changed, so you must either
  re-initialize your database (losing all the old info) with:

     ./drop_bacula_tables
     ./make_bacula_tables

  or you can use the appropriate script (you must choose the name according
  to which database you have) in the <bacula-source>/src/cats directory.

  BEFORE APPLYING THE ALTER SCRIPT PLEASE BACKUP YOUR DATABASE. Do one
  of the following only if you wish to keep your old tables (not doing
  the re-initialize documented above), and do this only after configuring
  an building the new Bacula, but before trying to run it:

  MySQL:
     cd working-directory (or where you want to backup the catalog)
     mysqladmin -f --opt bacula >bacula.sql
     cd <bacula-source>/src/cats
     ./alter_mysql_tables

  SQLite:
     cd working-directory
     echo '.dump' sqlite bacula.db >bacula.sql
     cd <bacula-source>/src/cats
     ./alter_sqlite_tables
      
  When you are sure that Bacula is running with your upgraded database,
  please delete the bacula.sql copy you made.
