  Thanks to Meno for this idea.
- Make some modifications to satisfy VC++.
- Apply Martin Simmons' second patch to compat.cpp to fix the line
  I previously missed.
- Apply Meno's fix to bnet that corrects use of ipaddr after free_addresses,
  back out my kludges, and it works.

- Added bsnprintf to address_conf.c
- Apply Marin Simmons patch to inet_aton() in compat.
- Build on Win32 -- required a few changes because of new IP code.

  jobs in Verify and Restore.
- Don't put commas in listing produced in restore so that users
  can cut and past JobIds without having commas in the way.

  This fixes (not yet tested) the Win32 errno problems in the compat lib.
- Fix btape compile problem reported by Martin Simmons -- thanks.
- Add ./configure detection of sys/tape.h

- Print a message when query.sql moved to query.sql.old during install.
- Move setting of FreeBSD chflags() to after utime() to avoid error
  messages is immutable bit is set.
- Turn off heartbeat in FD when -s is given so that we can 
  debug without a flood of signals.

- Add job message indicating that the job has been rescheduled
  and when.
- Fix job end time so that it is always updated. Previously it

- Add a number of "%s" in editing database errors -- security issue.
- Ensure that the NumVols is incremented and decremented in the
  pool record when Volumes are created or deleted.
- Cleanup error handling when labeling a tape. If vol was read-only,
  the device would still be marked as having found a label.

  this will fix the problem of noticing files have been moved
  into the save path after a Full save.
- Fix bug in "status dir" where not all entries are listed.
- Cleanup some improper result printing in configure.
- Optimize a couple of insertions in binary_insert of dlists.

Release 1.35.0 08 July 2004:
- Apply Christopher Hull's const patch for PostgreSQL
- Add code to block.c to detect if block header is destroyed.
- Add debug code for memset checking for zeroing 1900-3000 bytes
  which is what happened to the block headers.
- If block header is destroyed, read the next block. Probably
  should return with new status similar to the SHORT block 
  return.
- Add more debug info to bls for bad blocks.
- More implementation of DCRs.
- Eliminate argument passing in SD by using dcr.
- More int->bool conversions.
- Add file:block to a number of read/write error messages.
- More int -> bool conversions.
- Modify the SD piece by piece to use DCRs everywhere.
- Cleanup some printout for query command. 
- Fix typo in cats/mysql.c
- Work on cleaning up tape driver a bit (use bools, better calling
  sequences).
- Attempt to fix multi-Volume disk backup. Needs to be tested.
- Add Regular expressions to FileSet options.
- Correct configure.in to use ${MAKE} for doing the dependencies.
- Make MySQL and PostgreSQL try for 30 seconds to connect before
  giving up.  
- Correct Gnome 1.4 Makefile to build without cats library.
- Correct a crash reported (with patch) by Jonathan Soong 
  when attempting to backup an ACL on a symlinked file.
- Fixed an off by one bug in the new resources pointer code.      
  res_head array was one too small.
- Added Errors to last_job list. This allows detecting jobs
  that terminated in a warning.
- Implement setting the Win32 icon to yellow instead of red
  when the job terminated OK but with warnings.
- Fix the Win32 makefile and VC project file. The links were
  not including the Win32 dlls.      
- Delete some old Win32 code that was turned off.
- Eliminate a few more Win32 compiler warnings.
- Reduce the output produced by NIS (Win32 install builder).
- Simplify some of the #ifdefing in compat.h
- Rewrite spooling error handling when I/O error occurs. It is
  a bit tricky, requiring to truncate the file so that a despooling
  will work correctly. Needs to be tested.
- Make better subroutines for setting up for a new job.
- Start putting all DB ids on #defines (going to 64 bits).
- Fix gnome-console Makefile.in to work again.
- All "level=Incremental/Decremental" to the estimate command. This
  required some re-arrangement of subroutines at a fairly low level.
- Apply Piotr Jaworski's patch (patch-r-status.diff) to update the
  catalog status when a backup job starts running.
- Add (char*) cast to readline call in console.c for old readlines.
- Copy Makefile.in from gnome2-console to gnome-console (to eliminate
  need for cats library).
- Modify spooling code to handle write error (e.g. spooling disk full)
  more gracefully. Previously despooling would fail.
- Reduce casting in smartall.c a bit and add counters for 
  bytes, max_bytes, buffers and max_buffers.
- Fixed reload algorithm to stack both job end callback and the
  table id.
- Fixed the orphaned buffer after reload (job_end_push had to be
  destroyed.
- Destroy cond var (jcr->term_wait) only if initialized.
- Sort the Scheduled Jobs list by start-time, priority.
- Implement resources on a pointer.
- Fix Gnome console crash on up/down arrow with no history.
- Finish first cut of SIGHUP code. To make really work need res
  on a single pointer rather than in fixed memory.
- Fix a number of places in query.sql where multiple JobIds are
  printed (due to JobMedia records).
- Add new query: List jobs on Volume given Volume name.   
- Correct socket close on Win32 in bnet.c (in addition to compat.cpp).
  Caused fd leak in Win32 for each connection.
- Remove vol labeled test in askdir update_volume_info so that non-labeled
  Volume in catalog can be marked in error.
- Close socket in SD when connection rejected. Caused fd leaks.
- Initialize job_start_wait cond variable after every new_jcr() otherwise
  NetBSD gets error in library when trying to delete it without being inited.
- Fix typo (9 instead of 0) return status in write_new_volume_label.
- Fix mount.c to call routine that correctly marks a volume in error.
- Move code to rewrite volume label to subroutine -- a bit cleaner.
- Finish implementation and testing of new restore tree code.
- Implement feedback while tree is loading.
- Eliminate printing INFO message in UpdateDB (cats) -- it generates
  "false" error messages.
- Eliminate some GTK error messages when running the Gnome2 console.
- Begin restructuring tree.c for inclusion of the binary_insert()
  routine.         
- Apply Peter Eriksson's lib file order changes in linking for IRIX.
- Abort configure if Internal is  selected as the database.
- Add testimonials to the Web page
- Add the bugs list to the Web page "lists".
- Clarify the English in SuSE and Slackware when SD not running.
- Applied another extern "C" patch from Peter Eriksson.
- Fixed a bunch of VC warning messages.
- Applied the patches sent by Andreas Jellinghaus: build Gnome and  
  wx-console in client-only build if configured; add ./configure option
  to permit setting of sbin modes -- default is 0745 as before; remove
  cats library from Gnome console build; remove old version from Gnome
  About box. Thanks Andreas.
- Applied Peter Eriksson's const changes to the source code. Thanks Peter.
- Implemented a binary_insert() method for dlists -- intended to be used
  in the restore tree routines.
- Turned on my bsscanf() code, which replaces sscanf() by my routines, which
  are a subset of sscanf() used by Bacula, but which have known 32/64 bit
  behavior rather than vendor dependent !@#$%*.
