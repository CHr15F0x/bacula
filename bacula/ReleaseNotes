          Release Notes for Bacula 1.32

  Bacula code: Total files = 259 Total lines = 77,334 (*.h *.c *.in)

Major Changes this Release:
- Fixed gnome-console to compile with RH9 (Gnome 2.0)
- Implemented a single routine to read_records. It also returns
  a different record packet for each session.  This means
  that multiple simultaneous jobs should work.
- Implemented forward space file/block whenever possible 
  during restore.
- Added SDConnectTimeout to FD.    
- Added ClientRunBeforeJob and ClientRunAfterJob.
- Implemented Include | and < in File daemon.
- Implemented a new Include/Exclude syntax.
- Lots of fixes with variable expansion and counter variables
- Automatic labeling of tape Volumes is fixed.
- Recycling has been completely restructured and should work.
