       Release Notes for Bacula 2.5.42

  Bacula code: Total files = 521 Total lines = 204,881 (*.h *.c *.in)

The diff between 2.4.4 and 2.5.x is 208,340 lines, so this release
represents an enormous effort.

This Director and Storage daemon must be upgraded at the same time,
but they should be compatible with all 2.4.x File daemons, unless you
use some of the new features that affect the FD.  In other words, you should
not have to upgrade all your File daemons when you upgrade. However, any
release of version 2.5.40 or greater requires a database upgrade.

================== Warning !!!!!! ==========================

New Catalog format in version 2.5.40
------------------------------------

This BETA release of Bacula uses a new catalog format. We provide a set of
scripts that permit to convert a 2.4.x (version 10) catalog to 2.5.x (version
11). If you are using already a 2.5 version, you can drop the JobHistory
table before upgrading your catalog (if you are using the new "long term
statistics" module, you can upgrade this table the same way we do with 
the Job table, see the src/cats/update_bacula_tables script).

The simplest way to:
1. Stop any current version of Bacula from running.
2. Save a copy of your existing database.
3. Configure, build, and install the 2.5.42 version of Bacula
4. cd <your-scripts-installation-directory>
5. ./update_bacula_tables
6. If you have multiple catalogs, edit the update_bacula_tables
   script and put the name of another database, and then
   execute the script again. Repeat this until all Bacula
   catalogs have been updated.
7. Start the new Bacula.  If everything worked, it should
   not print any error messages.

The upgrade operation will convert the FileId index field of the File table
from 32 bits to 64 bits.  This operation will take TIME and will *temporarily* 
DOUBLE THE SIZE of your catalog. Bacula must be shutdown during this update,
so, won't be able to run jobs during this period.  For example, a 3 million files
catalog will take 2 mins to upgrade on a normal machine.  Don't forget to
backup it before executing the script.

If you start from scratch, you don't need to run the update_bacula_tables
script.  However, if you are using a version of Bacula older than 2.5.40,
then you need to run the update_bacula_tables script that will be found
in the <bacula>/src/cats directory after you run the ./configure command.
As mentioned above, before running this script, please backup your 
catalog database, and when you do running it, be sure shutdown
Bacula and be aware that running the script can take some time depending
on your database size.


New configure option :
----------------------

This BETA release of Bacula 2.5.x development code uses libtool
to generate the Bacula libraries as shared objects rather than
being directly linked in as in prior versions.  This means that
the Bacula shared objects, must either be in a shared object 
directory known to the loader or they must be in the directory
where the Bacula binaries are installed.  It is also possible
to explicitly specify the libraries directory on the ./configure
line (--libdir=/full-path/dir), but this should not be necessary.

If you have problems with libtool or you wish to use the old 
way of building libraries and linking them into Bacula, you 
can do so by disabling libtool on the configure command line with:

  ./configure --disable-libtool
==============================================================

This release includes large number of new features and changes.
It should be more or less compatible with previous xx.conf files
and File daemons providing that you are not using any of the new
features.

Please see the New Features chapter of the new manual, which documents
some but not all the new features (we are still working on it):
