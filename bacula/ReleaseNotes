          Release Notes for Bacula 1.33

  Bacula code: Total files = 259 Total lines = 78,303 (*.h *.c *.in)

Most Significant Changes since 1.32d
- Implement "update slots scan" that reads the volume label(s).
- The full form of the scan is "scan=1,2,4-5,7". With no specification,
  all occupied slots are scanned.
- Turn off changer Volumes that are not current in the changer when
  an "update slots" is done, or if any tape operation discovers that
  the right volume is not in the slot.
- Enhance "fill" command of btape.
- Added an autochanger test to the btape test command. It is automatically
  invoked if the autochanger is properly configured.
- New "estimate" and "lsmark" in restore command. Estimate gives
  a byte estimate for the restore, and lsmark does an ls listing 
  of marked files.
- Implement Fast Forward Space File.
- New version 1.5.5 Cygwin.
- Select the oldest LastWritten volume during recycling.
- Modify SD to update the catalog database when it is shutdown,
  even if the job is canceled.

Other Changes since 1.32d
- The console program will run all commands it finds in ~/.bconsolerc
  at startup.
- Add Dan Langille's changes to the bacula start/stop script that 
  permit dropping root permissions just after startup.

Items to note:  !!!!!
- The daemon protocol has changed, you must update everything at once.
- The database level has been updated. You must either re-initialize
  your databases with:
   
    ./drop_bacula_tables
    ./make_bacula_tables

  which will delete ALL prior catalog information, or you can
  update your database with:

    ./update_bacula_tables
- smtp has now become bsmtp
- console has now become bconsole.
- console.conf is now bconsole.conf
- Please don't underestimate the repercussions of the bsmtp and bconsole 
  name changes!
