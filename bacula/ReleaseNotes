          Release Notes for Bacula 1.33.4

  Bacula code: Total files = 306 Total lines = 90,715 (*.h *.c *.in)

Major Features:
- Data spooling which eliminates tape shoe-shine during Inc backups,         
  and permits multiple simultaneous backups without interleaved blocks.
- Native Win32 client -- much faster and restores permissions correctly
  (thanks to Christopher Hull)
- PostgreSQL database driver (thanks to Dan Langille).
- Polling of devices eliminating need to unmount and mount from
  console.
- Improved Autochange support of Slots (update slots scan).
- Autochanger support for multiple drives.
- New conio code to implement Console command line editing and history.
- JobDefs resource permits smaller .conf files for Director
- Access console lists for the Console
- Pool level overrides.
- Daemon statistics memory.
- Improved btape "test" and "fill" commands.


Items to note:  !!!!!
- The restore default is changed to have nothing selected by default.
  You must either enter: "restore all" or after getting into the tree
  selection prompt enter "mark *" to have everything selected.
- In previous versions the "all" keyword on the restore command caused
  it to return without user interaction after selecting everything. 
  This function is now replaced by the "done" keyword (more logical).
  The "all" keyword now causes everything to be selected by default.
- The default tape driver behavior is now to write only a single EOF
  at the end of the tape. For most tape drives, this is totally            
  transparent and nothing needs to be done. For FreeBSD see below.
- FreeBSD users NOTE!!!!!
  You may need the following two records to your SD Device resource for
  tape drives.

     TWOEOF = yes
     Fast Forward Space File = no

  The "Fast Forward Space File" is surely needed, and the TWOEOF          
  is needed on some systems and not others. Running the btape
  "test" command will tell you.

- The daemon protocol has changed, you must update everything at once.
- The database level has been updated. You must either re-initialize
  your databases with:
   
    ./drop_bacula_tables
    ./make_bacula_tables

  which will delete ALL prior catalog information, or you can
  update your database with:

    ./update_bacula_tables

  Please save your old database before dropping the tables or doing
  an upgrade or you may regret it later.

- smtp has now become bsmtp -- you *must* modify your .conf files.
- console has now become bconsole.
- console.conf is now bconsole.conf
- Please don't underestimate the repercussions of the bsmtp and bconsole 
  name changes!


New directives:
- "Close on Poll = yes/no" in SD Device resource.
- "Volume Poll Interval = time-interval" in SD Device resource.
- "Two EOF = yes/no" in SD Device resource.
- "Maximum Network Buffer Size = size" in SD Device resource.
- "Maximum Network Buffer Size = size" in FD FileDaemon (or Client) resource.
- "Console" new resource in Director conf file.
     New directives: Name, Description, Password, JobACL, ClientACL,
        StorageACL, ScheduleACL, RunACL, PoolACL, CommandACL,
        FileSetACL, CatalogACL.
- "Max Run Time = duration" in Director Job resource.
- "Max Wait Time = duration" in Director Job resource (not fully implemented).
- "JobDefs = name-of-resource" in Director Job resource.
- "Jobdefs" new resource in Director. Same directives as for a Job.
- "Full Backup Pool = xxx" in Job resource in the Director.
- "Incremental Backup Pool = xxx" in Job resource in the Director.
- "Differential Backup Pool = xxx" in Job resource in the Director.
- Three new options on the Run override statement in a Schedule resource:
   FullPool=xxx
   IncrementalPool=xxx
   DifferentialPool=xxx
- SpoolData=yes/no in DIR Job resource
- SpoolData=yes/no in Run override directive.
- MaximumSpoolSize in SD Device resource
- MaximumSpoolJobSize in SD Device resource
- SpoolDirectory in SD Device resource.

New Commands:
- "SetIP"
- Added "pool=xxx" to restore command line.
- Added "fileset=xxx" to restore command line.
- Fixed "storage=xxx" on restore command line.
- "markdir" command in restore tree.
- "unmarkdir" command in restore tree.
- "quit" command in restore tree.
- Trace option on "setdebug trace=1/0 ..."
- Update slots scan
- The "all" keyword on the restore command marks all files by default.
- The "done" keyword prevents user interaction with the tree -- used
  mostly for batch scripting.


Additional changes:
- Implement Gnome 2.0 restore GUI
- Add a missing unlock in the jobq handler.
- Fix bug where a soft linked file and a directory had the same name
  by treating the soft link as a directory and putting the entries under
  it. This fixes the bug reported by Alexander Mueller.
- Apply Jess Guardiani's second fix to list autochanger volumes without
  opening the drive (necessary on FreeBSD if no tape is in the drive).
- Reworked the command line handler in restore to walk through the
  arguments one at a time. This makes the file= entries work correctly.
  Also reworked the code that takes the MediaType and finds a 
  storage device.
- Add quit command to restore tree handler.
- Make restore tree handler remember if a hard link is present, and
  in doing a mark, only get database entry if there is a hard link.
  mark commands thus run at least 2 orders of magnitude faster.
- Add files=xxx field to run command submitted for restore.   
- Add yes to restore run command if either yes or run is command line
  argument.
- Make "yes" on command line argument skip prompt for modification of
  run job.
- Add markdir and unmarkdir -- both affect only the directory in
  question and do not do a recursive descent.
- Make tree command automatically mark all higher level directories to
  be restored when a directory or a file is selected.  Such directories
  are indicated by preceding the name with a + to indicate that only
  the directory entry is selected and not the whole directory tree.
- Modify a few tree commands to walk through all arguments rather than
  just taking the first one.
- Improved btape "test" and "fill" commands.
- The ability to ask the Storage daemon on a device by device basis
  to "poll" the tape drive at a given interval (minimum 1 minute). If
  a tape is found, its label is read and if appropriate it is used.
  This eliminates the need to do "mount" commands.
- The ability to close and re-open the device when a poll occurs. 
  This permits dealing with certain recalcitrant autochangers that
  invalidate devices (typically on FreeBSD).
- Dan Langille has written a PostgreSQL driver for Bacula.
- Implement "update slots scan" that reads the volume label(s).
- The full form of the scan is "scan=1,2,4-5,7". With no specification,
  all occupied slots are scanned.
- Turn off changer Volumes that are not current in the changer when
  an "update slots" is done, or if any tape operation discovers that
  the right volume is not in the slot.
- The console program will run all commands it finds in ~/.bconsolerc
  at startup.
- Add Dan Langille's changes to the bacula start/stop script that 
  permit dropping root permissions just after startup.
- New version 1.5.5-1 Cygwin.
- Modify SD to update the catalog database when it is shutdown,
  even if the job is canceled.
- Fixed seg fault in restore of multiple simultaneous jobs to 
  a single Volume.
- Fixed thread race problem in multiple simultaneous jobs to
  a single Volume where the volume label is not in the first 
  tape block, so the tape is not recognized.
- Restore directory tree automatically selects all higher level
  directories to be restored.
- Implement conio.c to use in console program -- mini-readline.
- Enhance "fill" command of btape -- simpler output. Use -v to
  cause last block to be dumped after write and after re-read.
- Added an autochanger test to the btape "test" command. It is 
  automatically invoked if the autochanger is properly configured.  It
  is still a bit primitive but covers the essential of testing
  the mtx-changer script with your autochanger.
- Select the oldest LastWritten volume during recycling.
- Added forward space file test to btape "test" command.
- All 1.32d patches applied.
- Fixed seg fault in restore of multiple simultaneous jobs to 
  a single Volume.
- Fixed thread race problem in multiple simultaneous jobs to
  a single Volume where the volume lable is not in the first 
  tape block, so the tape is not recognized.
