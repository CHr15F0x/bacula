          Release Notes for Bacula 1.36.1

  Bacula code: Total files = 396 Total lines = 116,418 (*.h *.c *.in)


Major Changes:
- There is a new Win32 pebuilder rescue disk thanks to Scott. This
  is worth the effort to checkout.
- A number of indexes have been removed from the PostgreSQL
  database to improve performance during backups. You may need to
  add these indexes if you do Verifies. See the scripts.
- We now have a Gentoo ebuild -- thanks Scott.
- There are a number of new ./configure options for the 
  bimagemgr. Please see the documentation or ./configure --help
- The RedHat autostart scripts disable using /lib/tls. If you
  don't want this you will need to turn it off.
- Corrected a problem with the default SD and FD conf files that
  incorrectly set Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1. This prevented
  running a job and obtaining the status at the same time.
- All daemon messages are now prefixed with a short date/time,
  and queued messages (generated in the comm routines) have the
  time the message was generated rather than the time the message
  was sent (usually much later).
- Fixed a bug with the autochanger code not respecting the InChanger
  flag.


New Directives:
- None since 1.36.0

New Commands:
- None since 1.36.0

Items to note!!!
- The output from Job reports has been modified to include the 
  seconds on the start/end times, the Storage device used, and to
  indent the output differently.
- If you created a PostgreSQL database under version 1.36.0, there
  are two things you might want to do. 1. manually remove some
  of the File table indexes to improve backup performance. See the
  make_postgresql_tables script. 2. run fix_postgresql_tables (in
  src/cats and updatedb) to correct a table. This is necessary only
  if you are creating disk Volumes greater than 2GB.
- As of 1.35.5 you MUST do a database update.
  
  cd scripts-dir (or src/cats)
  ./update_bacula_tables
   
- All daemons should be compatible with 1.34 with the exception
  of the new FileSet features such as regular expressions.
- Regular expressions are not supported in the Win32 FD.

Other Items:
- It is now possible to build the Rescue CDROM using a pre-installed
  static Bacula FD.
- Corrected a bug in the traceback code when Bacula was executed without
  a path. Tracebacks should now work in more cases.
- Corrected a typo in the traceback script.
- Fixed the mtx autochanger script so that it correctly waits on
  Linux systems (if you manually enable the code).
- Added grant all on cdimages for PostgreSQL users of bimagemgr.
- The actual Job start time is now correctly recorded in the catalog.
- You can now specify a JobId (or multiple ones separated by commas) on
  the restore command line.
- A -d50 will now turn on lots of debug code if you are having
  authentication errors.
- Found a workaround to a /lib/tls pthreads bug (a library seg fault).
- Added an ALERT message class for Alert messages.
- Fixed a seg fault in the restore tree routine when attempting
  to select certain files in the root directory.
- Allow other jobs to request new Volumes while operator intervention
  is needed -- previously all stalled.
- Enhancements to btape test (don't loop if certain tape errors occur).
- Improvements to the Win32 install.
