          Release Notes for Bacula 1.36.0

  Bacula code: Total files = 396 Total lines = 116,418 (*.h *.c *.in)


Major Changes:
- Tray monitor program (really cool)
- Bacula Rescue CDROM (easy to make and essential for emergencies)
- Bacula CD Image Manager
- General bug fixes/stabilization
- French translation of manual by Ludovic Strappazon well    
  underway.
- UTF-8 is supported in conio.
- Improved conf scanning code allowing FileSet components to
  be put on a single line (previously everything had to be on
  a different line).
- Win32 files restored to an alternate directory will have the
  colon following the drive letter turned into a / e.g. c: 
  becomes c/. Previously the c: was stripped. This applies only
  to files written to an alternate directory (i.e. using a where=).
- Certain open files (Word for example) can now be saved on
  Win32 systems.
- Default for Wild-cards on Win32 systems is to fold case this       
  should correct most of the problems users are having with
  exclusion on Win32.
- Lots of improvements in the Rescue scripts -- better 
  network detection, better mounting code, ...
- The attributes spool file can now exceed 2GB.
- Significant speed improvements when running PostgreSQL.
- Significantly faster restore command with very large 
  FileSets while building the in memory directory tree.
- Patches directory in the source will have all patches
  that have not been applied and released (new releases are
  only generated when really critical bugs are found).
- Bacula forces the tape drive into variable block mode
  on most systems (providing Bacula is running in variable
  block mode).
- dbcheck updated to remove many more orphaned records.
- Support for IPv6 (untested).
- Modifications to the license to termination clause for
  more protection from SCO type predators. No change for
  normal users.
- SIGHUP to Director causes it to reload conf file.

- Many improvements in the documentation.

New Directives:
- Added "Rerun Failed levels = yes/no" in the Job resource
  of the Director. It will upgrade the current job to a 
  higher level (Full or Differential) if a previous job
  of that level failed.
- Added "Ignore FileSet Changes = yes/no" in the FileSet
  directive of the Director. It prevents the Director from
  immediately upgrading the job to a Full save if you modify
  the contents of the FileSet. Not recommended. 
- Added "Block positioning = yes/no" in Device resource in SD.
  If set to no, Bacula should (as yet untested) be able to
  recover data from tapes where the drive was set to fixed
  blocksize but Bacula is in variable block size.
- Added "Multiple connections = yes/no" in Catalog record for
  allowing multiple simultaneous connections to the database.
  This is a major performance improvement for PostgreSQL and
  SQLite, but it is untested, so please test before putting
  it into production.
- Alert Command in SD permits checking for tape drive 
  alerts at the end of every job (or doing anything you want).
  An example of the command is in the default bacula-sd.conf
  file as well as in the Storage Configuration chapter of
  the manual.

New Commands:
- umount -- same as unmount.
- delete job now permits multiple jobids and ranges, e.g.:
    delete job jobid=1,3,5,11-16
- reload -- reloads bacula-dir.conf in Director.

Items to note!!!
- As of 1.35.5 you MUST do a database update.
  
  cd scripts-dir (or src/cats)
  ./update_bacula_tables
   
- All daemons should be compatible with 1.34 with the exception
  of the new FileSet features such as regular expressions.
- Regular expressions are not supported in the Win32 FD.

Other Items:
- Much better error messages from system errors particularly
  on Win32 and in running scripts.
- Many improvements in the SD.
- Full support for 64 bit machines.
- btape improved test and fill commands.
- See the ChangeLog for additional details.
