#  If you set in your Device resource
#
#  Changer Command = "path-to-this-script/mtx-changer" %c %o %S %a %d
#    you will have the following input to this script:
#
#  mtx-changer "changer-device" "command" "slot" "archive-device" "drive-index"
#		   $1		   $2	    $3	      $4	       $5
#
#  for example:
#
#  mtx-changer /dev/sg0 load 1 /dev/nst0 0 (on a Linux system)
#
#  If you need to an offline, refer to the drive as $4
#    e.g.   mt -f $4 offline
#
#  Many changers need an offline after the unload. Also many
#   changers need a sleep 60 after the mtx load.
#
#  N.B. If you change the script, take care to return either 
#   the mtx exit code or a 0. If the script exits with a non-zero
#   exit code, Bacula will assume the request failed.
