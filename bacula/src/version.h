 * If you turn on the NO_ATTRIBUTES_TEST and rebuild, the SD

 *  to disk, then when the data is written to tape, it will
 *  read back the attributes, but they will not be sent to
 *  the Director. So this will eliminate: 1. the comm time
 *  to send the attributes to the Director. 2. the time it
 *  takes the Director to put them in the catalog database.

/* 
* If you turn on NO_TAPE_WRITE_TEST and rebuild, the SD
*  will do all normal actions, but will not write to the
*  Volume.  Note, this means a lot of functions such as
*  labeling will not work, so you must use it only when 
*  Bacula is going to append to a Volume. This will eliminate
*  the time it takes to write to the Volume (not the time
*  it takes to do any positioning).
