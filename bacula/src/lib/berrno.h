/*
 * A more generalized way of handling errno that works with Unix, Windows,
 *  and with Bacula bpipes.
 *
 * It works by picking up errno and creating a memory pool buffer 
 *  for editing the message. strerror() does the actual editing, and
 *  it is thread safe.
 *
 * If bit 29 in berrno_ is set then it is a Win32 error, and we
 *  must to a GetLastError() to get the error code for formatting.
 * If bit 29 in berrno_ is not set, then it is a Unix errno.
