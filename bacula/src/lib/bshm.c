/*
 *   Bacula shared memory routines
 *
 * To avoid problems with several return arguments, we
 * pass a packet.
 *
 *  BSHM definition is in bshm.h
 *
 *  By Kern Sibbald, May MM
 *
 *   Version $Id$
 *
 *  Note, this routine was originally written so that the DEVICE structures
 *  could be shared between the child processes.  Now that the Storage
 *  daemon is threaded, these routines are no longer needed. Rather than
 *  rewrite all the code, I simply #ifdef it on NEED_SHARED_MEMORY, and
 *  when not defined, I simply malloc() a buffer, which is, of course,
 *  available to all the threads.
