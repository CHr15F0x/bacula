/*
 * Most of these message levels are more or less obvious.
 * They have evolved somewhat during the development of Bacula,
 * and here are some of the details of where I am trying to
 * head (in the process of changing the code) as of 15 June 2002.
 *
 *  M_ABORT       Bacula immediately aborts and tries to produce a traceback
 *                  This is for really serious errors like segmentation fault.
 *  M_ERROR_TERM  Bacula immediately terminates but no dump. This is for
 *                  "obvious" serious errors like daemon already running or
 *                   cannot open critical file, ... where a dump is not wanted.
 *  M_TERM        Bacula daemon shutting down because of request (SIGTERM).
 *
 * The remaining apply to Jobs rather than the daemon.
 *
 *  M_FATAL       Bacula detected a fatal Job error. The Job will be killed,
 *                  but Bacula continues running.
 *  M_ERROR       Bacula detected a Job error. The Job will continue running
 *                  but the termination status will be error.
 *  M_WARNING     Job warning message.
 *  M_INFO        Job information message.
 *
 *  M_RESTORED    An ls -l of each restored file.
 *
 *  M_SECURITY    For security viloations. This is equivalent to FATAL.
 *                (note, this is currently being implemented in 1.33).
 *
 *  M_ALERT       For Tape Alert messages.
 *
