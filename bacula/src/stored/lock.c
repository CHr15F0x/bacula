/*
 *
 * The Storage daemon has three locking concepts that must be
 *   understood:
 *
 *  1. dblock    blocking the device, which means that the device
 *               is "marked" in use.  When setting and removing the
                 block, the device is locked, but after dblock is
                 called the device is unlocked.
 *  2. dlock()   simple mutex that locks the device structure. A dlock
 *               can be acquired while a device is blocked if it is not
 *               locked.      
 *  3. r_dlock(locked)  "recursive" dlock, when means that a dlock (mutex)
 *               will be acquired on the device if it is not blocked
 *               by some other thread. If the device was blocked by
 *               the current thread, it will acquire the lock.
 *               If some other thread has set a block on the device,
 *               this call will wait until the device is unblocked.
 *               Can be called with locked true, which means the
 *               dlock is already set
 *
 *  A lock is normally set when modifying the device structure.
 *  A r_lock is normally acquired when you want to block the device
 *    i.e. it will wait until the device is not blocked.
 *  A block is normally set during long operations like writing to
 *    the device.
 *  If you are writing the device, you will normally block and 
 *    lock it.
 *  A lock cannot be violated. No other thread can touch the
 *    device while a lock is set.  
 *  When a block is set, every thread accept the thread that set
 *    the block will block if r_dlock is called.
 *  A device can be blocked for multiple reasons, labeling, writing,
 *    acquiring (opening) the device, waiting for the operator, unmounted,
 *    ...
 *  Under certain conditions the block that is set on a device can be    
 *    stolen and the device can be used by another thread. For example,
 *    a device is blocked because it is waiting for the operator to  
 *    mount a tape.  The operator can then unmount the device, and label
 *    a tape, re-mount it, give back the block, and the job will continue.
 *
 *
 * Functions:
 *
 *   DEVICE::dlock()   does P(m_mutex)     (in dev.h)
 *   DEVICE::dunlock() does V(m_mutex)
 *
 *   DEVICE::r_dlock(locked) allows locking the device when this thread
 *                     already has the device blocked.
 *                    if (!locked)
 *                       dlock()
 *                    if blocked and not same thread that locked
 *                       pthread_cond_wait
 *                    leaves device locked 
 *
 *   DEVICE::r_dunlock() unlocks but does not unblock
 *                    same as dunlock();
 *
 *   DEVICE::dblock(why)  does 
 *                    r_dlock();         (recursive device lock)
 *                    block_device(this, why) 
 *                    r_dunlock()
 *
 *   DEVICE::dunblock does
 *                    dlock()
 *                    unblock_device()
 *                    dunlock()
 *
 *   block_device() does  (must be locked and not blocked at entry)  
 *                    set blocked status
 *                    set our pid
 *
 *   unblock_device() does (must be blocked at entry)
 *                        (locked on entry)
 *                        (locked on exit)
 *                    set unblocked status
 *                    clear pid
 *                    if waiting threads
 *                       pthread_cond_broadcast
 *
 *   steal_device_lock() does (must be locked and blocked at entry)
 *                    save status
 *                    set new blocked status
 *                    set new pid
 *                    unlock()
 *
 *   give_back_device_lock() does (must be blocked but not locked)
 *                    dlock()
 *                    reset blocked status
 *                    save previous blocked
 *                    reset pid
