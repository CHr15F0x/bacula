cancel [jobid=<number> job=<job-name> ujobid=<unique-jobid>]
To be done in the context of a status dir graphical window.
Also in a "job resources window for job-name".

delete pool=<pool-name>
   should ask if this would have bad effects if say media existed in the pool
   the pool existed in the configuration file.

disable job<job-name>     and     enable job<job-name>
Could be done in the context of a jobs resource window which is not yet created

estimate
Could be a dialog in the context of a jobs window.

list
many are done or are reproduced by having windows

llist
same as list

prune files|jobs|volume client=<client-name> volume=<volume-name>
Should add as a dialog box from both client and medialist

release storage=<storage-name>
Would need to explain what this does in bat with a dialog

reload
could be done in console or on director's page selector widget

run
done

setdebug
I'd say we could choose not to implement this in bat

status
done, want to implement graphically

unmount storage=<storage-name> [ drive=\lt{}num\gt{} ]
done
unmount [ jobid=<id> | job=<job-name> ]
Mmmmm

update media, volume, pool, slots
media/volume still has more work, they are the same after all

use
still need to make decisions about how to handle multiple catalogs

var
Mmmmmm

version
could be done in console as long as it is explicite about that it is the version
of the director

quit
I'd like to have a disconnect graphical option.

exit
Not really needed

wait
Mmmmmmm

CONFIG FILE
===========================
add [pool=<pool-name> storage=<storage>  jobid=<JobId>]
These are done from config files

create [pool=<pool-name>]
Done in a config file

CHOOSE NOT TO (for now at least)
===========================
autodisplay on/off
could be done in the context of the console
   This may interfere with our connection issues
   Also, there is a configurable qt timer to automatically ask for messages

python
not needed from bat??

DONE
===========================
automount on/off
Added buttons to the label dialog box to execute automount command

delete [volume=<vol-name> job jobid=<id>]

help
could be in the console window

label
Done by kern before I started

purge files jobid=<jobid>|job=<job-name>|client=<client-name>
purge volume|volume=<vol-name> (of all jobs)
purge jobs client=<client-name> (of all jobs)

relabel
done
