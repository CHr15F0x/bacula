autodisplay on/off
could be done in the context of the console

automount on/off
could be done in the context of the console, because is for after a label
command as opposed to a property of a storage device

cancel [jobid=<number> job=<job-name> ujobid=<unique-jobid>]
To be done in the context of a status dir graphical window.

delete pool=<pool-name>

disable job<job-name>     and     enable job<job-name>
Could be done in the context of a jobs window which is not yet created

estimate
Could be a dialog in the context of a jobs window.

help
could be in the console window

list
many are done or are reproduced by having windows

llist
same as list

python
not needed from bat??

prune files|jobs|volume client=<client-name> volume=<volume-name>
Should add as a dialog box from both client and medialist

purge files jobid=<jobid>|job=<job-name>|client=<client-name>
purge jobs client=<client-name> (of all jobs)
purge volume|volume=<vol-name> (of all jobs)
  this one is done from media

release storage=<storage-name>
Would need to explain what this does in bat with a dialog

reload
could be done in console or on director's page selector widget

run
done

setdebug
I'd say we could choose not to implement this in bat

status
done, want to implement graphically

unmount storage=<storage-name> [ drive=\lt{}num\gt{} ]
done
unmount [ jobid=<id> | job=<job-name> ]
Mmmmm

update media, volume, pool, slots
media/volume still has more work, they are the same after all

use
still need to make decisions about how to handle multiple catalogs

var
Mmmmmm

version
could be done in console as long as it is explicite about that it is the version
of the director

quit
I'd like to have a disconnect graphical option.

exit
Not really needed

wait
Mmmmmmm
