<h4>Welcome and What is The BAT.</h4>

<p>Welcome to the bacula administration tool.  The bat is a graphical interface 
to communicate with and administer the bacula director daemon.  If you have been
using bacula for a while, your familiar with bconsole, the text based interface
to administer bacula.  With bat, the user can use the console class to perform
any command that can be done from bconsole, and more.

<p>The bat is bconsole with extra communication capabilities and a set of 
graphical user interfaces that utilize those capabilities.  A bat programmer is 
able to design interfaces interact with the director in all ways that a user
can, by executing commands.  When a command is entered by the interface, bat
will type in the command in the console and will often times change the
interface visible to the console so that the user can see the command as well
as the resulting output from the director.  Bat can also do some requests of the
daemon, that the user normally would not do.   These would be the ability to
retrieve lists of various resources and also to perform requests of the director
to query the sql server the daemon is using and return the results to bat.
