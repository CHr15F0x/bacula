<h4>What is the BAT.</h4>

<p>Welcome to the bacula administration tool.  The bat is a graphical interface 
to communicate with and administer the bacula director daemon.  If you have been
using bacula for a while, your familiar with bconsole, the text based interface
to administer bacula.  With bat, the user can perform any command that can be
run from bconsole, and more.

<p>The bat is bconsole with extra communication capabilities and a set of 
graphical user interfaces that utilize those capabilities.  A bat programmer is 
able to create interfaces interact with the director in all ways that a user
can, by executing commands.  When a command is entered by an interface, bat
will type in the command in the console and will often times change the
visible interface to the console so that the user can read the command as well
as the resulting output from the director.  Bat can also perform requests of the
daemon, that the user normally would not do.   These would be the ability to
retrieve lists of various resources and also to perform requests of the director
to query director daemon's sql server.  The director will then forward the
query results to bat.
