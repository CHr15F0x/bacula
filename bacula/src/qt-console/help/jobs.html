<h4>The Jobs Interface</h4>

<p>The Jobs interface will show the list of job resources.  The data displayed
for each job in this list are the defaults for the resource as defined in
the bacula-dir configuration file.  These defaults are the values that will be
used when a job is run because it was scheduled to.  They are also the values 
that will be filled in by default if the job is run manually.

<p>The context sensitive list that pops up when a job is right clicked will
include a number of commands as well as 2 to open up other interfaces.

<p>The user can run a list files command in the console that will display a
list of job id's that have been run and some associated data.  This is similar
output to what can be seen in the joblist interface.

<p>The console command list volumes can be run to output a list of volumes that
have this jobs files stored on it.

<p>The list nextvolume console command will tell the user the next volume that
will be asked for when this job is run.  It will also show a list of past jobs.

<p>There are options to run commands to enable or disable the job as scheduled.
If disabled, the job will be re-enabled when the director daemon is restarted.

<p>The cancel job command will cancel any running job id's with this job
definition.

<p>The open joblist option will create a new JobList interface and pre-populate
the job dropdown list selecting only jobid's run with this jobs resource.

<p>The run job option will open up the run job interface prepopulating the job
dropdown box with the selected job.
