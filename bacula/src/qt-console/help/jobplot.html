<h4>The Job Plot Interface</h4>

<p>The Job Plot interface will have all of the same selection widgets as the 
Job List interface.  It will also have widgets that will effect the plot's
display.  These settings  should be saved and used the next time the interface
is opened.  The user can change the Graph type to one of sticks, lines, steps
or none.  The user can also turn one or both of the plots off with the File
Data and the Byte Data check boxes.  The symbol type for each plot's points
can be changed as well.
