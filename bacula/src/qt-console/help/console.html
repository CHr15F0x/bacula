<h4>The Console</h4>

<p>The Console is the interface that displays all of the text that would 
normally be displayed in bconsole.  Use the command window that by default is
at the bottom of the window to manually enter in any command like would be done
with bconsole.

<p>There are 2 icons in the taskbar which are designed to run console commands.

<p>Use the status <img src="../images/status.png" width="32" height="32">
icon in the taskbar to run the status dir command.

<p>Use the messages <img src="../images/mail-message-new.png" width="32" 
height="32"> icon in the taskbar to run the messages command.

<p>There will be no attempt to document console commands here.  An alphabetic list of
the commands can be found on the following web url
http://www.bacula.org/rel-manual/Bacula_Console.html
