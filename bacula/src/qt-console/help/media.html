<h4>The Media Interface</h4>

<p>The Media interface will display a tree structure of pools, and under each
pool branch, will be items representing the volumes in the pool.  The display
will show data that are the values in the database for each volume.  With this
interface, the user can manage tape volumes and file volumes.

<p>The context sensitive menu will allow the user to open up other interfaces
and to perform commands in the console that may be run with the desired media
having been identified.  These commands include deleting the volume, purging
the jobs and files backed up on the volume from the catalog, and pruning the 
jobs and files on the catalog that meet the selection criterion configured in
bacula-dir.conf.  There is also a command to reset the parameters on the volumes
based on the parameters of the pool resource.

<p>Other interfaces can be opened up from the context sensitive menu.  You can open
up a Job List interface with the media drop down widget preselecting the jobs
that have been written to the selected volume.  The user can open up the relabel
dialog box.  The user can also open up the Edit a Volume interface which will
allow the user to modify all user editable data items for the volume.
