<h4>The Media Interface</h4>
<font size=+1>

<p>The Media interface displays a tree structure of pools, and under each
pool branch, are items representing the volumes in the pool.  The display
shows data that are the values in the database for each volume.  With this
interface, the user can manage tape volumes and file volumes.

<p>The context sensitive menu allows the user to open up other interfaces
and to perform commands in the console that may be run with the desired media
having been identified.  These commands include deleting the volume, purging
the jobs and files backed up on the volume from the catalog, and pruning the 
jobs and files on the catalog that meet the selection criterion configured in
bacula-dir.conf.  There is also a command to reset the parameters on the volumes
based on the parameters of the pool resource.

<p>Other interfaces can be opened up from the context sensitive menu.  The user
may open up a JobList interface.  This interface is opened with the media
drop down control preselected  This shows jobs that have been written to the
volume.  The user can open up the Relabel a Volume dialog box.  The user can also open
up the Edit a Volume interface which allows the user to modify all user
editable data items for the volume.
