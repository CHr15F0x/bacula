<h4>The Storage Interface</h4>

<p>The Storage interface will show a list of storage resoruces and to allow the
user to right click on a storage to popup a context sensitive menu.  The list of
storages is a tree structure and will show the storage id and the auto changer
flag.

<p>The context sensitive menu will allow the user to perform commands in the 
console that may be run with the desired storage having been identified.  These
commands include requesting the status of the storage, and to mount, unmount and
release the media in the storage device.

<p>If the autochanger flag is true, there will be two additional options in the 
context sensitive menu.  These are options to run the commands to update slots
and the command to update slots scan.
