<h4>The Storage Interface</h4>
<font size=+1>

<p>The Storage interface shows a list of storage resoruces and allows the
user to right click on a storage to popup a context sensitive menu.  The list of
configured storage device resources is a tree structure and shows the storage id
and the auto changer flag.

<p>The context sensitive menu allows the user to perform commands in the 
console that may be run with the desired storage having been identified.  These
commands include requesting the status of the storage, and to mount, unmount and
release the media in the storage device.

<p>If the autochanger flag is true, two additional options in the context
sensitive menu are found.  These are options to run the command to update slots
and the command to update slots scan.
