<h4>The Clients Interface</h4>
<font size=+1>

<p>The Clients interface will show a list of clients and to allow the
user to right click on a client to popup a context sensitive menu.  The list of
clients is a tree structure and will show a number of attributes from the database
for each client. 

<p>The context sensitive menu will allow the user to perform commands in the 
console that may be run with the desired client having been identified.  These
commands include requesting the status of the client, and pruning or purging
jobs and files from the catalog.

<p>To understand pruning and purging, please read the Bacula documentation at
