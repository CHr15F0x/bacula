====================================================
Color code termination code in joblist.  Create class to display messages from
a specific job.  Want the ability to create an instance of that class from
joblist.  I also want a table to convert termination code into human readable
text.

Test left pane of restore with 2 windows drives in one backup job.

User preferences.  With log to stdout options.
Have settings for defaults of limits on joblist

Add context sensitive options for most commands
status dir on page select director item
All items with jobid= that I thought could work from joblist are done.
As well as many more
update slots scan
see COMMANDS file

Option in joblist like with restore from jobid but restore populating timestamp
of the selected job.

Resolve issue of connection during restore selection.  Could go with preempt of
connections.  (Kern is to work on)

Purging not working from console or from context sensitive.  (Kern)

========LOW priority items:
Allow for selecting multiple jobs to restore from in joblist.  Right click
restore from job works, but not with multiple selected jobs.

Is there a way to query the director/database for whether a storage is currently
mounted so I am not presenting both mount and unmount to the user??

Is there a way to identify a slot as having a cleaning tape???
(Kern says more work needs to be done in bacula with autochangers)

See if there is a solution to images fun with designer other than:
%s/<iconset>[\.\/]*:images/<iconset>images/g
%s/<iconset>images/<iconset>..\/images/g

Think about good ways to clean up the Console creation part of the
loop creating pages.
========================================================
This release or next:

A window showing a list of jobs and defaults.  Defaults can be gotten in manner
similar to what the first restore window does.

A window showing a list of schedule resources. 

Kern discussed windows showing statistics like web based interfaces.
========================================================
Future Releases :

The ablility to modify configuration files to create jobs, schedules, filesets
and any other director resources.

The ablility to modify configuration files to create storage resources.

Add a status dir graphical interface.  It would auto update every ?? seconds
and have a list of scheduled jobs, and in the que to run jobs that could be
cancelled graphically.

Add a status client window.  Keep updating showing what file is being
processed.

bRestore add code to get working.

===========================================================
NOT SURE
===========================================================

I'm not sure about this one??  Things seem to work and I did not do a
thing to make it happen:  the "dir" is a member of Console

- We also must somehow make the low level I/O routines know which
director/console to use.  Currently they always use the single
global one defined in the mainWin class (if I remember right).

============================================================
DONE:
============================================================
show purged flag in joblist.  Don't have purge option show if already purged.

move behavior of:
  MainWin::setContextMenuDockText
  MainWin::setTreeWidgetItemDockColor
to the pages class

preempt all connections to console with 
if (!is_connectedGui())
or some other mechanism.  May find more as users start finding them.

Create documentation for any other developers interested in creating
new classes to add more pages.  Explain how to use the pages class
and about not populating until the tree widget is clicked etc...

Add numerous are you sure dialog boxes.  Like are you sure you want to
delete/purge that volume.  Show a little of the documentation about what
the consequences of delete or purging are.

A Tree widget context sensitive menu option and class to jump from known job
to surf the filestructure on the job.
  This was future, but it is kind of done with restore from jobid

Get rid of "Warning: name layoutWidget is already used" when make uic's restore.ui

Create the ability to start a restore from joblist.  Right click, select
"restore from Jobid=xx" create an instance of restore defaulting in the jobid
or a list of selected jobs.

Update README  describe bat.conf.example to bat.conf

Test restore and get anything not working, working.
Add inteligence to prerestore.

Color code Media Red->Error Append->green Full/Used->Yellow

Get restore into stack.
  Should the jobs dialog be turned into a page as well??
Possilbe: Turn run and label into docked pages. (remove button bar buttons??)

Where and bootstrap are confused in runjobs of restore.
   This was just the labels.

Create list of what does not work.
From what I can tell, just the restore window on the left.

Add option to LIMIT the number of jobs shown in all jobs page for users with
multiple hundreds to thousands of jobs.

Play with includes to Make these compiles shorter.
  moved includes of of includes and into files only console.h should be long

relabel storage=DDS3 oldvolume=ddsvol003 volume=dds3vol003 slot=3 pool=dds3_hope
in label slot spinner, limit the upper to the value of slots for that storage.

Fix bug in myth box not working with .sql query="" command.
This was a fix in mysql

Figure out how to get tables like Joblist to do the equivalent of double clicking
on the separating lines between each of the headings.
Tried the hard way first.  Oops.

If the console command line entry docked widget gets the focus, make 
m_currentConsole the top widget by setting the treewidgetitem selected.
Did this in MainWin::input_line almost better to let the person see
whatever they want until they hit enter.

Set Window titles to reflect what director it is.

Must:: get page selector to follow undocked windows.  Otherwise
current console won't be current.

Re-add class for storage, I accidentally reverted because I left
it on my laptop.  This is why I like committing often.

Add class for FileSets

Another idea for what you have implemented:
- I think that the dynamic pages that you create on the fly
should be nested under the item that creates them more like a
directory tree.

For example: Jobs on Volume xxx, probably should be shown under
"All Jobs" (or Media if that is what created it) and "Jobs of
Client Rufus" probably should be shown under "Clients".  I base
this on looking at the Select page list after I have brought up 3
or 4 dynamic pages.  Once there are a good number, I get a bit
confused where they came from.  This would also permit selecting
multipe Volumes then displaying multiple pages, one for each
Volume selected.  If they are nested, then that nested level can
be expanded or collapsed, which would be pretty cool at keeping
information, but getting it out of the way, sort of like what
happens for a directory tree.

dhb: ref above
My original concept was to put these in a tabbed widget.  Your Idea may
make for a cleaner user experience.  I like it.  It could save the
effort of getting a tabbed widget to work.


- I think we need to make the current Director more explicit, by
perhaps highlighting it in the page selector when it is current
and unhighlighting it when it is not (we could use color as we do
for the console, though some color blind people may have
problems.

- When any director is clicked, we need to set it as the current
director and set the current console as well.

Remove DoubleClicking, From pages class not needed any more.

Broken with multiple directors:
- If you click on the second director, it will probably open, but
none of the pages that are defined below it will be able to talk
to it.  They will most likely talk to the first director.

- When any console is clicked we need to set it as the current
console (m_console) and also set its director as the current
director (m_topItem).  These are in the mainwin class.

- When any page is selected, we must set both the current
director (m_topItem) and current console (m_console) that this
page is connected to.

dhb:
m_topItem has been changed to Console::directorTreeItem()
m_currentConsole->directorTreeItem(); returns disired treeWidgetItem

- We also need a concept of a "local" director/console for each
page, so the page knows who it is talking to -- this doesn't
currently exist, so I think we must pass the director and console
to each page widget constructor.
 
dhb:
m_currentConsole is saved in each page subclass's m_console.  This value
is set by all but the console class calling Pages::pgInitialie() in it's
constructor

In short, there is a lot of work to be done to make multiple
simultaneous directors work.

dhb:
this may be moot:

If the above prooves to be too much, we might consider to only
have a single director at a time, and simply let the user select
which director he wants to connect to (one at a time, but
dynamically).  In the end, this may be the best thing to do, so
any user who wishes to connect to multiple directors would run
two instances of bat.  I am a bit unsure now, but the above list
of things to do is much bigger than I thought it was going to be.
