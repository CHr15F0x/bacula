This directory contains the Bacula Admin Tool (bat).

At the current time, the contents of this directory are under
development.  If you want to help, please contact Kern directly.
If you want to build it, you need Qt4 loaded and setup as your
default Qt or with the appropriate Qt Environment variables set.

To build bat, you simply enter:

  qmake
  make
    
then to execute it

  ./bat

The qmake command needs to be entered only if you add a new file, in
which case, you should edit bat.pro.in and add the new filename
in the appropriate place.  In running qmake, it will build a new 
Makefile, and there after, you simply use "make". In fact, providing
you edit bat.pro, doing a "make" will automatically call qmake to
rebuild the Makefile.

Development status as of 27 Feb 07.

Items implemented:
- Reads a basic bat.conf (same as documented for the gnome-console 
   except that the Font part is unimplemented).
- Basic main window structure
- About dialog
- Quit menu item
- Will automatically connnect to the first Director in the
  conf file. Doesn't know about multiple Directors.
- The Director name will appear in the Selection tree followed
  by Console and Restore.  
- Clicking on Console brings forward the console display screen
  (default at startup).
- Clicking on 
- Clicking on bRestore brings up a brestore page that is not active.
- The command line is implemented.
- The status line (below the command line) is implemented.
- Selection of Font is implemented.
- The Font and the window size are saved on exit and restored on
  execution of bat.
- The Status menu bar icon is implemented.

Items not implemented:
- None of the menu items except About, Select Font, and Quit.
- Nothing on the brestore page
- The Label menu bar item, prints on the shell window what you entered.
- The Run menu bar item, prints on the console window what you entered.
- The Restore menu bar item, brings up dialog, then when OK is
  clicked, it goes on to the next dialog, which is meant to be
  a tree view, but for the moment does nothing ...  It is a bit
  ugly. Cancelling it should get you back to the normal command prompt.
         
Not working:
- The left selection window and the right window (where the console
  is) are dockable windows so should be movable once they are properly
  clicked.  Well, they sort of move, but then get stuck.  I haven't figured
  out what is going on, so for the current time, I am implemeting most
  stuff through dialogs.
     
Design/implementation considerations:
- We need to have multiple Directors
- Each Director should have its own console
- The Console class needs to be a list or be attached to the
  currently active Director.
- Need icons in front of the Director.
- The console page should be in a DockWidget so it can be removed
  from the main window. It is currently in a dock window, but it
  does not remove properly -- more research needed.
- Need to figure out a good implementation of adding pages and even
  having plugins that load as pages.  Currently the page mechanism
  is a bit kludged.

Design decisions:
- If possible all code for a particular component will be kept in
  and appropriate subdirectory.
- All private class variables are named "m_xxx" this makes it very
  clear if one is referencing a class variable or a local.
- All signal/slots are connected by explict code (most all are
  done in the MainWin constructor), rather than using designer.      
- Each page has a separate designer .ui file in a subdirectory.
- All windows are created with designer and have
  a name such as xxxForm i.e. the main window is MainForm and kept
  in main.ui.  

Major projects:
- Implement a restore page that does a directory tree restore selection
  much like wx-console does.
- Implement other restore interfaces such as brestore ...
- Implement a database browser
- Implement graphical commands that allow updating most aspects of
  the database (i.e. commands for label, update Volume, ...)
- Implement a resource (conf file) browser
- Implement a reports page -- e.g. something similar to bweb
- Implement Qt plugins to add new functionality to bat
- Implement a GUI configuration file editor (something like JBacula).
