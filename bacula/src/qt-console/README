If you want to build it, you need Qt4 loaded and setup as your
default Qt or with the appropriate Qt Environment variables set.

To build the qt-console, you simply enter:

  qmake 
  make
    
then to execute it

  ./qt-console

The qmake command needs to be entered only if you add a new file, in
which case, you should edit qt-console.pro and add the new filename
in the appropriate place.  In running qmake, it will build a new 
Makefile, and there after, you simply use "make".
