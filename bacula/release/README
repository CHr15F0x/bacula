This directory contains the scripts that we use to create a new
set of release files.

In general, you do the following:

1. Copy the entire contents of this directory out of the 
   Bacula source tree (this may not be required, but is cleaner).

2. Edit the makeall file, and update the following enviroment variables
   to point to the correct directories on your system.  They should
   point to directories that contain git repos:

   bacula
   docs
   rescu

3. Ensure that the environment variable "version" is set correctly 
   (yes, this could be automatically pulled from $bacula).

4. Run the makeall script.  There should be no errors.  If 
   there are, fix them, and re-run the script or re-run the scripts
   that makeall calls:

   makeclean
   makebacularel ...
   makedocsrel ...
   makerescuerel ...
   makewinrel ...

5. All the output files should be put in this directory.

6. Before releasing, detar the main Bacula source into some
   directory and run all the regression tests using the files
   in the bacula-xx.xx.xx.tar.gz file.  This ensures that there
   are no missing files.          

7. Also before releasing, run at least one backup using the 
   Win32 and/or Win64 file daemon.
