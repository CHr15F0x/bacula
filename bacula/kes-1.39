General:

Changes to 1.39.3:
20Dec05
- Modify gui on command to set only GUI mode and not batch.
- Modify .messages command to always print messages regardless
  of the mode.
- If GUI mode is on, suppress automatic printing of 
  You have messages. 
- Delete old bnet packet code.
- Ignore new BNET_START_SELECT and BNET_END_SELECT signals in
  wx-console.
- Modify restore command in wx-console to set gui on and to use
  only .messages instead of messages.  Hopefully this fixes bug
  #514.
- Fix seg fault in exit of acquire when canceling a job --
  reported by Wolfgang Denk
- Pull in latest reservation system changes from 1.38
- Make .messages command always print messages regardless
  of the automessages flag.
17Dec05

- Remove quotes around Version as it breaks things.
16Dec05
- Merge in Aleksandar Milivojevic's mods to the spec file.

- Thorsten fixed Unicode cd problem with wx-console bug 505.
14Dec05
- Correct reservation system to do a last ditch try
  for any mounted volume, then anyone anywhere.
- Add quotes around table Version because of
  error in MySQL 4.1.15 -- bug report submitted.
- Correct some minor problems with btape in the fill
  command.
- Updates to ssh-tunnel from Joshua Kugler.
- Added a report.pl program from Jonas Bjorklund.            
- Simplify the O_NONBLOCK open() code for tape drives,
  and always open nonblocking.
- Do not wait for open() if EIO returned (shouldn't happen).
- Eliminate 3 argument to tape open().
- Correct the slot # edited in the 3995 Bad autochanger unload
  message.
- With -S on bscan (show progress) do not divide by zero.
13Dec05
- Make cancel pthread_cond_signal() pthread_cond_broadcast().
- When dcr is freed, also broadcast dev->wait_next_vol signal.
- Remove unused code in wait_for_device.  
- Make wait_for_device() always return after 60 seconds of wait.

Changes to 1.39.2:
13Dec05
- Add stubs for non-crypto build.
12Dec05
- Use localhost if no network configured
11Dec05

- Remove debug print.
- Add bail_out in error during state file reading.
10Dec05

- Add stubs for pygtk-console code
- Create Makefile.in for pygtk-console code
09Dec05
- Merge updates into 1.38 branch
- Update specs to include mysql4 define.
- Fix when attributes are sent, must be after binit().
- Stop read_record() if status not ok in second loop.
- Return rec->FileIndex in dcr->VolLastIndex for normal
  and partial records in read_record().  This allows bscan
  to get FileIndex at EOT correct.
- Fix butil.c to correctly set dcr -- fixes seg fault in bls.
08Dec05
- Fix Win32 built to work with new crypto code.
- Apply patch supplied by user (slightly modified) to fix
  correct detection of holes in block devices and FIFOs. 
  Bug # 506.

  to fix SD hang with multiple pools and bad client
  IP. Fixes bug # 508.
07Dec05
- Add nagios plugin to the examples directory. Submitted by
  Christian Masopust.
- Remove warning message about multiple saves of hardlinked files
  from find_one.c as it can generate too many warning messages.
- Modify most restore error messages to be queued so that they
  appear at the end of the job rather than mixted with the restore
  listing where they could be "lost".
06Dec05
- Reset timeout values before select() per patch from 
  Frank Sweetser for problems with non-blocking sockets.
- Unlink the state file if either reading or writing it gets
  errors.  Hopefully this will fix Win32 exit problems.
- Add sanity check in append.c to ensure that dcr is not NULL.
  This can happen if multiple drive autochanger SCSI control
  channel and drive indicies do not correspond.
05Dec05
- Get next volume from Scratch pool before creating a volume.
- Set new Pool defaults in Vol when moved from Scratch Pool.
- Remove argument from create_bacula_database for SQLite as it
  caused an error.
- Add back index code so that two drive autochangers can get
  a second tape.
- Change a bunch of debug levels to aid debugging autochangers.
- Fix reservation so that mutexes are properly applied.
- Rework reservation algorithm so that two drives can be used
  at the same time.
04Dec05
- Landon merged his data encription changes into the HEAD
- Apply days keyword patch from Alexander.Bergolth at wu-wien.ac.at 
  If this patch is applied, the number of days can be specified with
  "list nextvol days=xx"
  or
  "status dir days=xx"
  My use case is to be able to preview the next scheduled job (and the 
  next tape to be used) on fridays if there are no scheduled jobs during 
  the weekend.
