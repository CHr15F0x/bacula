              Technical notes on version 1.39  
                        Kern Sibbald

General:

Changes to 1.39.2:
07Dec05
- Remove warning message about multiple saves of hardlinked files
  from find_one.c as it can generate too many warning messages.
06Dec05
- Reset timeout values before select() per patch from 
  Frank Sweetser for problems with non-blocking sockets.
- Unlink the state file if either reading or writing it gets
  errors.  Hopefully this will fix Win32 exit problems.
- Add sanity check in append.c to ensure that dcr is not NULL.
  This can happen if multiple drive autochanger SCSI control
  channel and drive indicies do not correspond.
05Dec05
- Get next volume from Scratch pool before creating a volume.
- Set new Pool defaults in Vol when moved from Scratch Pool.
- Remove argument from create_bacula_database for SQLite as it
  caused an error.
- Add back index code so that two drive autochangers can get
  a second tape.
- Change a bunch of debug levels to aid debugging autochangers.
- Fix reservation so that mutexes are properly applied.
- Rework reservation algorithm so that two drives can be used
  at the same time.
04Dec05
- Landon merged his data encription changes into the HEAD
- Apply days keyword patch from Alexander.Bergolth at wu-wien.ac.at 
  If this patch is applied, the number of days can be specified with
  "list nextvol days=xx"
  or
  "status dir days=xx"
  My use case is to be able to preview the next scheduled job (and the 
  next tape to be used) on fridays if there are no scheduled jobs during 
  the weekend.
