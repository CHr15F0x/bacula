updatedb scripts
13 Feb 2004

These scripts may be used to update older versions of bacula
databases. The scripts are designed using the standard install
locations for mysql, sqlite and the bacula working directory
as configured in the rpm builds. If you have different locations
you will need to edit the $bindir variable and the working
directory location before running them.
