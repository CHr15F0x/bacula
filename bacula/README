As you will note, I don't follow the standard GNU release
numbering conventions, but rather one that I started in
1970.  My internal releases were 0.nn, the first release to
another user was 1.0, each modified source code release then
gets a new minor release (1.1, 1.2, ...) as well as a date.  Each
major change in the software -- e.g.  new tape format will
normally have the major release number incremented.

Your best bet for getting Bacula up and running is to read
the manual, which can be found in
<bacula-main-directory>/doc/html-manual, or in
<bacula-main-directory>/doc/bacula.pdf.

Barring reading the manual, you might try the
following:

To Configure it:

  ./configure \
    --sbindir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --sysconfdir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --with-pid-dir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --with-subsys-dir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --with-sqlite=$HOME/depkgs/sqlite \
    --enable-gnome \
    --with-mysql=$HOME/mysql \
    --with-working-dir=$HOME/bacula/bin/working \
    --with-dump-email=YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
    --with-job-email=YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
    --with-smtp-host=YOUR_SMTP_SERVER_ADDRESS

Note, if you do not have readline installed on your
system, you either need to add:
     
     --disable-readline 

or add:

     --with-readline=$HOME/bacula/depkgs1/readline

where I assume you have loaded depkgs1 into $HOME/bacula
and built the readline routine.      

If you want to use SQLite, please download depkgs and
build sqlite, then add something like:

    --with-sqlite=$HOME/depkgs/sqlite


Build Bacula:

   make

   If you are doing a port, there should be no errors.  The most
   likely source of errors will probably come in the src/stored
   directory in time.c or dev.c.  There may also be problems in
   lib/signal.c as I currently pull in all Linux signals, some of
   which may not be available on your system.

To create the database:

   src/cats/make_bacula_tables

To install:

   make install

To start it:

   cd $HOME/bacula/bin
   ./bacula start

To start it (as a developer). This is not appropriate if you
are installing Bacula.

   ./startit
   ./console (or ./gnome-console)

To stop it:

  ./stopit

Well, it is all just a bit more complicated than that,
but you should have the idea.

Be sure you read the chapter about testing your tape drive!
Don't waste a lot of time setting up and running Bacula, if
your drive is not supported.

FreeBSD users, pay special attention to the Device configuration
parameters needed to deal with FreeBSD tape drivers.
