                        Kern Sibbald

General:
Release 1.38.11 (28Jun06) released 28JunO6
28Jun06
- Add test for IRIX64 as OS
- Fix scheduler hang during clock shift (due to missing unlock())
- Minor tweaks to bregex.c
- Fix to block.c to correctly check for DVD number of parts.
- Fix to dev.c to permit DVD seeking in spool file.  Corrects
  label rewriting problems.
- Clarify license for techlogs (GPL). I consider them "part" of
  the source code of Bacula.
- Use FDL license for developer's manual, French translation, German
  translation, bimagemgr manuals (same as the main manual), and
  the web site.

Release 1.38.10 (08Jun06) released 12JunO6
08Jun06
- Modify setting ACLs to suppress error message if the file is a
  symbolic link since the file linked to may not yet be created,
  and symbolic links really should not have attributes ...
- Remove old regex code from baconfig.h
06Jun06
- Complete implementation of acl.c error message during restore.
  During backups, errors getting acls are silently ignored, as was
  previously the case.

  scheduler fixes for reload and day light savings change, 
01Jun06
- Implement partial error messages for src/filed/acl.c
- Fix return code to fail when doing update barcodes and
  Pool resource is not found. This previously caused Volumes
  to be labeled as cleaning tapes.
- Small updates to projects file.
26May06
- Prevent DVD code from rewriting label if the device cannot be
  opened read/write.
- Fix Dir/SD run race in migrate.c, verify.c, and restore.c
- Update projects file.
24May06
- Applied patch posted by Jaime Ventura to bug #570 to correct failure
  of restarted jobs to complete (due to a destroyed pthreads conditional
  variable used by the message thread).
- Fixed bug #619 where Bacula would not restart jobs with MaxRestartTimes
  set to zero. 
- Apply patch from John Goerzen bug #611 to fix bad manual links in the code.
- Apply patch from Rudolf Cejka bug #614 to removed trailing
  colons in query.sql file.
- Apply patch from Rudolf Cejka bug #613 to correct prunning of files
  not to create orphans.

  in restore long listing.
- Apply patch from Rudolf Cejka bug #609 to use MarkId in verify.c instead
  of incorrect MarkedId.
- Apply patch from adioso bug #616 to correct text in manual (replace
  Director with File daemon).
21May06
- Move DIR "run" command to SD before starting the message thread
  as suggested by Cristopher Hull to avoid a race deadlock from
  two threads using the bsock structure.
- Modify LICENSE to correct some problems pointed out by Debian.
05May06
- Correct EOF with no \n lex.c problem.
- Add additional INFO messages if autochanger cannot be used.

  of the reload problems.

Release 1.38.9 (02May06) released 02MayO6
02May06
- Added code to strip backslashes from Windows filenames during
  a restore.
- Corrected Win32 License to use the correct LICENSE file.
- Corrected the buffer count and bytes reported in the heap 
  statistics.
26Apr06
- Implement an NT_() macro to indicate that text should NOT
  be translated.
- Fix a number of incorrect strings marked for translation, when
  they should not be (e.g. commands).
- Fix StartTime bug reported for ClientRunBeforeJob and RunBeforeJob
  Patches supplied by user in bugs #608 and #599.
- Use most recent of st_ctime and st_mtime in restore tree DIR
  listing. This fixes some problems with Win32 printing incorrect
  values.
- Correct the clock shift comm time calculation between the DIR
  and the FD. It was added rather than subtracted.
- Strip all backslashes in filenames to be restored on Win32
  machines -- the names should all be in Unix format, and if
  there are any backslashes it is most likely due to an improper
  FileSet definition, and the files will not otherwise be 
  restorable.
- Remove lib/regex.c (replaced by bregex.c).
- Delete src/win32/License.txt
- Modify installer to install LICENSE
25Apr06
- Add back ua_label barcode fix from Rufolf Cejka.

- Implement using pg_config for finding PostgreSQL files.
  Fixes bug #600. Patch supplied by user.
- Remove -t option from mktemp in mtx_changer.in and use
  working directory. Fixes bug #578.
- Update job start time after the any run before job so that
  files created by the script are only backed up once. Fixes
  bug #599.
- Strip trailing newline only from filenames entered in
  the restore command when reading a file. This permits
  the user to enter filenames with trailing spaces. Fixes
  bug #549. The user supplied a patch that I modified slightly.
- Use the most recent time (st_mtime, st_ctime) in the dir
  command in restore. This gives the user a better idea of what
  the newest file really is. This fixes bug #574. The fix
  was suggested by the user.
18Apr06
- Remove the -f option from the chown in Makefile.in for more
  portability.
- Change setting the group in Makefile.in to use chgrp for
  more portability.
- Implement a Bacula read/write lock for Python rather
  than using the Python lock to avoid recursive problems.

10Apr06
- Remove automatic case folding on Windows FDs. You must
  explictly use the 'Ignore Case = yes' option.
- Remove the code added to 1.38.6 and 1.38.7 that pulls a
  scratch volume in an Autochanger early in the 'recycling'
  algorithm.  
08Apr06
- Tweak license to include Microsoft restrictions.
- Move mysql.reconnect to after real_connect().  Thanks to
  Frank Sweetser for the patch.

  as many FC5 g++ compiler warnings as possible.
25Mar06
- Split the bacula start/start script into four files:
   bacula         -- starts and stops calling other scripts
   bacula-ctl-dir -- starts/stops the director
   bacula-ctl-fd  -- starts/stops the File daemon
   bacula-ctl-sd  -- starts/stops the Storage daemon
24Mar06
- Create datestyle fix for PostgreSQL. Fixes bug #574.
- Correct editing of JobId from int to int64 in fd_cmds.c
- Eliminate FileSet name race with bash_spaces() and multiple
  threads by bashing in a local.
- Fix error return from 'use storage' to print a correct error
  message rather than nothing.
- Correct false re-read last block error message when two jobs

- Suffle lock order in reserve to avoid deadlock between
  reservation lock and device mutex.
- Add Thorsten's VSS timeout code to 1.38 branch.
21Mar06

  tracking this down for me !!!! as it broke the Win32 build.
20Mar06
- Integrate addition of line count limitation to bsmtp -l from
  Sebastian Stark <stark at tuebingen.mpg.de>
17Mar06
- Implement regex test program in tools directory.

  restore, if polling is turned on.     
- Disallow multiple storage specifications for a job. Should fix Arno's
  problem.
- Add back a missing store of poolid in jr.poolid.

14Mar06
- Add more jcr methods and make mutex and use_count private.
- Create lock/unlock methods for jcr.
- Fix PostgreSQL bug doing sql_data_seeek() by explicitly reading
  records to get to seek position.
- Integrate patch from bug #561 to correct conio.c signal definitions.
- Fix Rescheduling failed Jobs. Ensure that SD message thread 
  terminates correctly by doing pthread_kill(). Do not destroy
  SD cond wait variable between executions of the job. Use local
  mutex for cond variable to avoid blocking jcr chain. Fix poor 
  use of jcr use count in jobq.c for restarted jobs.
- Fix obsolete usage of foreach_dlist() to use foreach_jcr() in
  lib/jcr.c -- prevents locking the jcr chaing.
- Apply patch from bug #564, which corrects listing volumes with
  multiple autochangers. Apply same fix to next volume list.
- Fix bug #562 where restore bootstrap file is not unique.
- Use new routine lock_reservations() to lock the reservations
  system, and call it while looking for a volume in askdir.c.
  This could possibly fix bug #543.
- Stop SD command loop if job is canceled.

09Mar06
- Use John Kodis' edit_with_suffix code to edit VolBytes.
- Backport some fixes for acquire.c. Most importantly, to explicitly
  have a reserved_device flag for acquire_for_read().  Hopefully
  this will correct the remaining issues with failed restores holding
  a drive.
- Add a job_canceled() check in SD command loop.

Release 1.38.6 beta3 4Mar06
04Mar06
- The po files should now be current.
- Fix new sql_use_result() code to properly release the
  buffers in all cases.
- Convert to using new Python class definitons with (object).

Release 1.38.6 beta1 24Feb06
24Feb06
- Don't open default catalog if not in ACL.

22Feb06
- Add virtual disk autochanger code.
- Add user supplied bug fix to make two autochangers work
  correctly using StorageId with InChanger checks.
- Correct new/old_jcr confusion in copy_storage().
- Remove & from Job during scan in msgchan.c -- probably
  trashed the stack.
- When getting the next Volume if no Volume in Append mode   
  exists and we are dealing with an Autochanger, search
  for a Scratch Volume.  
- Check for missing value in dot commands -- bug fix.
- Fix bug in update barcodes command line scanning.
- Make sure Pool Max Vols is respected.
- Check that user supplied a value before referencing
  it in restore -- pointed out by Karl Hakimian. 
- Add Karl Hakimian's table insert code.
- Don't ask user to select a specific Volume when
  updating all volumes in a Pool.
- Remove reservation if set for read when removing dcr.
- Lock code that requests next appendable volume so that
  two jobs to get the same Volume at the same time.
- Add new Device Type = xxx code. Values are file, tape,
  dvd, and fifo.
- Preserve certain modes (ST_LABEL|ST_APPEND|ST_READ) across
  a re-open to change read/write permission on a device.
- Correct a misplaced double quote in certain autochanger  
  scripts.
- Make make_catalog_backup.in a bit more portable.
- Implement Karl Hakimian's sql_use_result(), which speeds
  up restore tree building and reduces the memory load.
- Correct a number of minor bugs in getting a Volume from  
  the Scratch Pool.
- Implement additional command line options for update Volume.
- Don't require user to enter a Volume name when updating

Release 1.38.5 released 19Jan06:
19Jan06
- Apply label barcodes fix supplied by Rudolf Cejka.
18Jan06
- Modify standard rpm installation to set SD group to disk
  so that SD will by default have access to tape drives.
- Allow users to specify user/group and start options
  for each daemon in /etc/sysconf/bacula file.           

Release 1.38.4 released 17Jan06:
16Jan06
- Add two new queries to query.sql provided by Arno. One
  list volumes known to the Storage device, and the other
  lists volumes possibly needing replacement (error, ...).
15Jan06
- Add periodic (every 24 hours) garbage collection of memory 
  pool by releasing free buffers.
14Jan06
- Correct bug counting sized (for display only) in smartall.c
- Print FD mempool stats if debug > 0 rather than 5.
12Jan06
- Make db_lock() mutex error fail the job rather than abort
  Bacula.  Canceling the job caused the mutex to fail.
- Correct bug in alist.c that re-allocated the list if the
  number of items goes to zero.
- Move the reservation system thread locking to the top level
  so that one job at a time tries all possible drives before
  waiting.
- Implement a reservation 'fail' message queue that is built         
  and destroyed on each pass through the reservation system.
  These messages are displayed in a 'Jobs waiting to reserve
  a drive' list during a 'status storage='.  Note, multiple
  messages will generally print for each JobId because they
  represent the different problems with either the same drive
  or different drives.  If this output proves too confusing
  of voluminous, I will display it only when debug level 1
  or greater is enabled in the SD.
11Jan06
- Add enable/disable job=<job-name>.  This command prevents
  the specified job from being scheduled. Even when disabled,
  the job can be manually started from the console.
- During 'update slots' clear all InChanger flags where the
  StorageId is zero (old Media records).

Beta release 1.38.4:
09Jan06
- Fix autochanger code to strip leading spaces from returned
  slots number. Remove bc from chio-changer.
- Back port a bit of 1.39 crypto code to reduce diffs.
- Fix first call to autochanger that missed close()ing the
  drive. Put close() just before each run_program().  Fixes
  Arno's changer bug.
07Jan06
- Add PoolId to Job record when updating it at job start time.
06Jan06
- Pull in more code from 1.39 so that there are fewer file
  differences (the new ua_dotcmds.c, base64.h, crypto.h
  hmac.c jcr.c (dird and lib) lib.h md5.h parse_conf.c 
  util.c. Aside from ua_dotcmds.c these are mostly crypto
  upgrades.
- Implement new method of walking the jcr chain. The
  incr/dec of the use_count is done within the walking
  routines.  This should prevent a jcr from being freed
  from under the walk routines.

Release 1.38.3 05Jan06:
04Jan06
- Move the suitable_drive flag to a better place to prevent
  premature termination of the reservation if all drives
  are busy -- should fix Arno's diff/inc pool failures.
26Dec05
- Add mutex to single thread VSS code in Win32.

Beta release 23Dec05:
22Dec05
- Add OPENSSL_INC to console dependencies, lib dependencies, and
  wx-console dependencies in Makefile.in
- Add OPENSSL INC/LIB to gnome2_console Makefile.in.
- Simplify code in askdir.c that waits for creating an appendable
  volume so that it can handle multiple returns from the wait
  code.
- Modify the wait code to permit multiple returns.
- Return a zero when 'autochanger drives' is called and
  it is not an autochanger.
- Make rewind_dev() a method taking a DCR as an argument.
  This permits closing and reopening the drive if the
  rewind fails as happens if the drive was loaded while the
  file descriptor was open. This refreshes the file descriptor.
- Remove the ST_OPENED flag and always rely on fd < 0 for knowing
  if the device is open or not.  This should eliminate
  Arnos problem.
- Return error if reserve cannot find at least one suitable device.
- Make wait_for_sysop() return correct state information.
- Fix Win32 state file problem. write was not using compat
  code. This should fix bug #500.
21Dec05
- Modify gui on command to set only GUI mode and not batch.
- Modify .messages command to always print messages regardless
  of the mode.                
- If GUI mode is on, suppress automatic printing of 
  You have messages. 
- Delete old bnet packet code.
- Ignore new BNET_START_SELECT and BNET_END_SELECT signals in
  wx-console.
- Modify restore command in wx-console to set gui on and to use
  only .messages instead of messages.  Hopefully this fixes bug
  #514.
Beta release 20Dec05:
20Dec05
- Fix seg fault in exit of acquire when canceling a job --
  reported by Wolfgang Denk
19Dec05
- Implement load balancing code.

  for any mounted volume, then anyone anywhere.
- Add quotes around table Version because of
  error in MySQL 4.1.15 -- bug report submitted.
- Correct some minor problems with btape in the fill
  command.
- Updates to ssh-tunnel from Joshua Kugler.
- Added a report.pl program from Jonas Bjorklund.            
- Simplify the O_NONBLOCK open() code for tape drives,
  and always open nonblocking.
- Do not wait for open() if EIO returned (shouldn't happen).
- Eliminate 3 argument to tape open().
- Correct the slot # edited in the 3995 Bad autochanger unload
  message.
- With -S on bscan (show progress) do not divide by zero.
  Bug #510
13Dec05
- Make cancel pthread_cond_signal() pthread_cond_broadcast().
- When dcr is freed, also broadcast dev->wait_next_vol signal.
- Remove unused code in wait_for_device.  
- Make wait_for_device() always return after 60 seconds of wait.
12Dec05
- Use localhost if no network configured

- Add bail_out in error during state file reading.
Beta release 10Dec05:
09Dec05
- Merge updates into 1.38 branch
- Update specs to include mysql4 define.
- Stop read_record() if status not ok in second loop.
- Return rec->FileIndex in dcr->VolLastIndex for normal
  and partial records in read_record().  This allows bscan
  to get FileIndex at EOT correct.
- Fix butil.c to correctly set dcr -- fixes seg fault in bls.
08Dec05
- Apply patch supplied by user (slightly modified) to fix
  correct detection of holes in block devices and FIFOs. 
  Bug # 506.
- Apply patch supplied by user (slightly modified) 
  to fix SD hang with multiple pools and bad client
  IP. Fixes bug # 508.
07Dec05

  Christian Masopust.
- Remove warning message about multiple saves of hardlinked files
  from find_one.c as it can generate too many warning messages.
06Dec05
- Reset timeout values before select() per patch from 
  Frank Sweetser for problems with non-blocking sockets.
- Unlink the state file if either reading or writing it gets
  errors.  Hopefully this will fix Win32 exit problems.
- Add sanity check in append.c to ensure that dcr is not NULL.
  This can happen if multiple drive autochanger SCSI control
  channel and drive indicies do not correspond.
05Dec05
- Get next volume from Scratch pool before creating a volume.
- Set new Pool defaults in Vol when moved from Scratch Pool.
- Remove argument from create_bacula_database for SQLite as it
  caused an error.
- Add back next_vol index code so that two drive autochangers can get
  a second tape.
- Change a bunch of debug levels to aid debugging autochangers.
- Fix reservation so that mutexes are properly applied.
- Rework reservation algorithm so that two drives can be used
  at the same time.
04Dec05
- Apply days keyword patch from Alexander.Bergolth at wu-wien.ac.at 
  If this patch is applied, the number of days can be specified with
  'list nextvol days=xx'
  or
  'status dir days=xx'
  My use case is to be able to preview the next scheduled job (and the 
  next tape to be used) on fridays if there are no scheduled jobs during 
  the weekend.
