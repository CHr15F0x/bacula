              Technical notes on version 1.38  
                        Kern Sibbald

General:

Release 1.38.3 05Jan06:
04Jan06
- Move the suitable_drive flag to a better place to prevent
  premature termination of the reservation if all drives
  are busy -- should fix Arno's diff/inc pool failures.
26Dec05
- Add mutex to single thread VSS code in Win32.

Beta release 23Dec05:
22Dec05
- Add OPENSSL_INC to console dependencies, lib dependencies, and
  wx-console dependencies in Makefile.in
- Add OPENSSL INC/LIB to gnome2_console Makefile.in.
- Simplify code in askdir.c that waits for creating an appendable
  volume so that it can handle multiple returns from the wait
  code.
- Modify the wait code to permit multiple returns.
- Return a zero when "autochanger drives" is called and
  it is not an autochanger.
- Make rewind_dev() a method taking a DCR as an argument.
  This permits closing and reopening the drive if the
  rewind fails as happens if the drive was loaded while the
  file descriptor was open. This refreshes the file descriptor.
- Remove the ST_OPENED flag and always rely on fd < 0 for knowing
  if the device is open or not.  This should eliminate
  Arnos problem.
- Return error if reserve cannot find at least one suitable device.
- Make wait_for_sysop() return correct state information.
- Fix Win32 state file problem. write was not using compat
  code. This should fix bug #500.
21Dec05
- Modify gui on command to set only GUI mode and not batch.
- Modify .messages command to always print messages regardless
  of the mode.                
- If GUI mode is on, suppress automatic printing of 
  You have messages. 
- Delete old bnet packet code.
- Ignore new BNET_START_SELECT and BNET_END_SELECT signals in
  wx-console.
- Modify restore command in wx-console to set gui on and to use
  only .messages instead of messages.  Hopefully this fixes bug
  #514.
Beta release 20Dec05:
20Dec05
- Fix seg fault in exit of acquire when canceling a job --
  reported by Wolfgang Denk
19Dec05
- Implement load balancing code.
- Pull a few files from 1.39 where we can maintain compatibility.
- Rewrite reservation algorithm again. Rename variables to be
  more logical, add HEARTBEAT with Director, allow cancel of
  jobs stuck in reservation, add last resourt any_drive.
17Dec05
- Remove quotes from Version table name -- it breaks things.
- Fix seg fault if user labels a drive directly bug #513
- Remove quotes around Version as it breaks things.
16Dec05
- Merge in Aleksandar Milivojevic's mods to the spec file.
- Apply sparse code fix for raw drives and fifos. Bug 506
- Thorsten fixed Unicode cd problem with wx-console bug 505.
Beta release 14Dec05:
14Dec05
- Correct reservation system to do a last ditch try
  for any mounted volume, then anyone anywhere.
- Add quotes around table Version because of
  error in MySQL 4.1.15 -- bug report submitted.
- Correct some minor problems with btape in the fill
  command.
- Updates to ssh-tunnel from Joshua Kugler.
- Added a report.pl program from Jonas Bjorklund.            
- Simplify the O_NONBLOCK open() code for tape drives,
  and always open nonblocking.
- Do not wait for open() if EIO returned (shouldn't happen).
- Eliminate 3 argument to tape open().
- Correct the slot # edited in the 3995 Bad autochanger unload
  message.
- With -S on bscan (show progress) do not divide by zero.
  Bug #510
13Dec05
- Make cancel pthread_cond_signal() pthread_cond_broadcast().
- When dcr is freed, also broadcast dev->wait_next_vol signal.
- Remove unused code in wait_for_device.  
- Make wait_for_device() always return after 60 seconds of wait.
12Dec05
- Use localhost if no network configured
11Dec05
- Eliminated duplicate MaxVolBytes in cat update -- bug 509.
- Remove debug print.
- Add bail_out in error during state file reading.
Beta release 10Dec05:
09Dec05
- Merge updates into 1.38 branch
- Update specs to include mysql4 define.
- Stop read_record() if status not ok in second loop.
- Return rec->FileIndex in dcr->VolLastIndex for normal
  and partial records in read_record().  This allows bscan
  to get FileIndex at EOT correct.
- Fix butil.c to correctly set dcr -- fixes seg fault in bls.
08Dec05
- Apply patch supplied by user (slightly modified) to fix
  correct detection of holes in block devices and FIFOs. 
  Bug # 506.
- Apply patch supplied by user (slightly modified) 
  to fix SD hang with multiple pools and bad client
  IP. Fixes bug # 508.
07Dec05
- Add nagios plugin to the examples directory. Submitted by
  Christian Masopust.
- Remove warning message about multiple saves of hardlinked files
  from find_one.c as it can generate too many warning messages.
06Dec05
- Reset timeout values before select() per patch from 
  Frank Sweetser for problems with non-blocking sockets.
- Unlink the state file if either reading or writing it gets
  errors.  Hopefully this will fix Win32 exit problems.
- Add sanity check in append.c to ensure that dcr is not NULL.
  This can happen if multiple drive autochanger SCSI control
  channel and drive indicies do not correspond.
05Dec05
- Get next volume from Scratch pool before creating a volume.
- Set new Pool defaults in Vol when moved from Scratch Pool.
- Remove argument from create_bacula_database for SQLite as it
  caused an error.
- Add back next_vol index code so that two drive autochangers can get
  a second tape.
- Change a bunch of debug levels to aid debugging autochangers.
- Fix reservation so that mutexes are properly applied.
- Rework reservation algorithm so that two drives can be used
  at the same time.
04Dec05
- Apply days keyword patch from Alexander.Bergolth at wu-wien.ac.at 
  If this patch is applied, the number of days can be specified with
  "list nextvol days=xx"
  or
  "status dir days=xx"
  My use case is to be able to preview the next scheduled job (and the 
  next tape to be used) on fridays if there are no scheduled jobs during 
  the weekend.
03Dec05
- Fix font code in gnome2 console user patch. Fixes bug #501.
- Fix malformatted bnet error message that caused seg fault
  fixes bug 502

- Ensure that StorageId is stored in Media record when ever possible.
- Add Migration Job to Job.
- Change Start Storage daemon job to require read and write storage
  pointers.
- Pass read storage data to SD as well as write storage data.
- Remove old code from winservice.cpp
- Break on error in scan.
