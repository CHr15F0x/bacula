- Upload everything to appropriate part of Source Forge
  and release it.  I use releaseforge 
- After releasing everything.
- Either download everything and compare the signatures,
  or simply check the upload sizes of everything.
- cd docs/manual
  make
- Upload new release doc to web site.
  Upload bacula.pdf to web site.
