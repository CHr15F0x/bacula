              Technical notes on version 1.39  

General:
14Nov06
kes  Implement code to pass the MediaId to the SD. The SD then uses
     this MediaId when creating JobMedia records. This fixes a bug
     with Migration where the MediaId got set to the second Volume
     read rather than the write Volume.  Possibly (unlikely) fixes
     bug #709.
kes  Remove NextPool from Job resource.
kes  Edit a few numbers in the restore dialog with commas.
kes  Note, the DIR<->SD protocol has changed.
13Nov06
kes  Replace () by {} in configure.in for proper HP configuration.
kes  Shorten some lines over 80 characters in filed/backup.c
kes  Cast sizeof() in filed/backup.c to avoid compiler warning.

Version 1.39.28 released: 
12Nov06
kes  Change error message 'illegal' to 'invalid' -- bug #707
kes  Add rather primitive device resource deadlock detection in
     the job queue handler. It detects the same read and write device
     for migration and cancels the job. 
kes  Start adding a unique_dbid_hander() routine in migration to avoid
     duplicate mediaids and duplicate jobids.
kes  Add patch from bug #708 to permit relative paths such as ../xxx
     in the restore tree routine.
kes  Add Eric Bollengier's patch to reduce locking time in the SD after
     despooling, and thus many jobs finish faster.
kes  Correct locking order of reservations lock and device mutex in
     reserve.c -- this should correct Arno's deadlock that occurred
     when doing mount/unmount at the same time a job is reserving a
     drive.
05Nov06
rbn  Fixed problems with encryption when combined with compression 
     or sparse files.  Unfortunately this means that all previous 
     encrypted backups can't be restored.
rbn  Fixed problem in bfgets with Windows and Mac end of lines.
rbn  Fixed bug in Windows version of close_bpipe() that cause programs
     like bsmtp() to hang waiting for the pipe to be closed.  Fixed 
     binary file type problems in open_bpipe().
rbn  Fixed a number of bugs in the mysql DB scripts.
03Nov06
ebl  Fix broken runscript on director. (RunBefore, RunAfter)
ebl  Use M_ERROR instead of M_FATAL in runscript.c
31Oct06
ebl  Small fix src/dird/job.c to add JobErrors count to catalog.
rbn  Ignore UTF-8 marker at the start of .conf files.
rbn  Add stab2cv to 3rd party dependencies.  This is a utility I 
     wrote that is licensed under the GPL and available on SourceForge.  
     It converts the stab debugging info generated by gcc into Codeview 
     format.  Currently it just translates function names to global 
     symbols.  This is sufficient to get reasonable stack traces from 
     Dr Watson and to look at minidumps.
rbn  Fix bug # 699 - winbacula client crashes whilerunning bat scripts.
rbn  Enable Windows XP look and feel for the tray icons and wx-console.
rbn  Add Windows specific FileSet example to bacula-dir.conf.
rbn  Reorganize Start menu so that documentation and configuration are 
     in subfolders.
21Oct06
rbn  Change daemons and utilities so that if -c is omitted from the 
     command line AND there is no configuration file in the current 
     directory then the 'standard' configuration file (eg 
     /etc/bacula/bacula-*.conf) will be used.  If the argument to -c 
     doesn't contain any path separators AND there is no configuration 
     file by that name in the current directory then the 'standard' 
     configuration file directory will be searched for a file by that 
     name.
rbn  Fixed restore on Windows so that backslashes as path separators works.
rbn  Add missing query.sql file to Windows installer.
rbn  Fixed Windows versions of catalog backup scripts.
20Oct06
kes  Fix optional files in Makefile.in of src/filed that caused
     a syntax error when using no optional files.
15Oct06
lf   Fix a cosmetic bug in filed.c that caused spurious OpenSSL error
     messages; there is no reason to attempt to load a private key.
     from master key files.  

Version 1.39.26 released: 
12Oct06 
kes  Apply the three patches from Richard Mortimer.
     bacula-reposition.patch, bacula-tape-reopen.patch, and
     bacula-eod.patch. This corrects tape positioning on older devices,
     and also a problem with btape.
kes  Apply fix from bug report #696 where writing to a FIFO does not
     work due to a dumb typo.
kes  Unlock the tape door before the file descriptor is released. This
     should fix lots of somewhat subtle failures when using an autochanger.
11Oct06
kes  Correct mtx-changer bug that I introduced in a recent commit, and
     pointed out by Robert Nelson -- thanks.
rbn  Fix Windows' daemons so that messages print to stdout if not 
     running as a service.
rbn  Add daemon name to trace file name (eg bacula-dir.trace).
rbn  Fix environment variable expansion in directory names on Windows.
rbn  Fix autochanger support in fill command.
rbn  Update SQL scripts to match Unix versions.
rbn  Fix daemon usage displays.
rbn  Cleanup bacula-dir.conf template.
rbn  Install openssl.cnf so that the openssl.exe installed in the
     Bacula\bin directory can be used to generate keys and 
     certificates for TLS and encryption.
rbn  Fix cleanup of spool files on Windows.
rbn  Remove /silent option from daemons on Windows.  The new default 
     is the same as the old /silent.  To enable the message boxes that 
     previously were suppressed by /silent you must add /debug instead.
     NOTE: As a result of this change, the first time you upgrade from 
           a previous version of 1.39.x you will receive the message 
           boxes when the remove of the old services succeeds.  This 
           is the same behaviour as when migrating from a version prior 
           to 1.39.0.
     However, going forward, these message boxes will not appear on 
     upgrades or new installs.
rbn  Add new /debug option. This option enables the message boxes that 
     previously were suppressed by the /silent option.  In addition the 
     daemons running as services will open a console window if this 
     option is used.
rbn  Fix bug with service not being removed on migrated installs.  This 
     should correct those cases where the file daemon install was failing
     when upgrading from versions prior to 1.39.x.
08Oct06
kes  Turn on heap reporting in Dir with zero debug level.
kes  Send a message to the sys log when Bacula forces a SEG FAULT, and
     send the same message to stdout.
07Oct06
kes  Begin work on new GUI 'console'.
kes  Make configure look in non-standard MySQL library directory 
     for Solaris.
kes  Make mtx-changer automatically configure the autochanger wait
     procedure for Solaris, FreeBSD, and Linux.  Previously, only Linux
     was implemented.
kes  Correct drop_sqlite_tables.in script to not delete the database.
kes  When writing to a log file, close and reopen the file descriptor
     if there is an error writing the file.
kes  Modify the autochanger loaded?, load, and unload commands to print
     the full text of any mtx output if there is an error.  Helps to
     ease diagnosis of autochanger problems.
kes  Correct a few Win32 errno returns in the VSS code so that hopefully
     a resonable Win32 error message will be printed.
kes  Convert a few strcat()... to bstrncat() in the Win32 code.
06Oct06
rbn  Added Windows version of bsmtp.
rbn  Fixed path search for Windows so that Bacula\bin is automatically 
     searched for programs and scripts.
rbn  Fixed bugs in mtx-changer.cmd and made template bacula-sd.conf
     Windows specific.

Version 1.39.24 released:
02Oct06
kes  Apply dvd find volume patch from Richard Mortimer.
kes  Eliminate the dvd specific mount routines using only the
     dev->mount/unmount.
kes  Make update_free_space a method of DEVICE and rename 
     update_freespace.
01Oct06
kes  Require a messages command acl to be able to receive messages
     in a console.
kes  Add console, system, and scan job types in util.c.
28Sep06
kes  Print the Volume purged message only for real jobs to keep
     from cluttering up the daemon messages.
kes  Lock the tape drive door while Bacula is using the device.
kes  Add back the 'No Jobs running' message to FD and SD status because
     my regression script depends on it, and I'm too lazy to change the
     scripts.
kes  Start using structure assignments (not too happy about it ...).
kes  Fix a bug in the tools Makefile that broke on Solaris.
kes  Unload any autochanger drive during a 'release' command.
26Sep06
kes  Enhance error message when restoring without bootstrap file.
kes  Check restored size only for regular files.
kes  Store Python job level in job record in Dir.
kes  Add back code to open tape device nonblocking, but if rewind fails
     release file descriptor.
kes  Modify acquire.c to first try autoloading the device. Also, ask operator
     to mount tape if drive cannot be opened.
rbn  Made Windows service tray status windows resizable.
rbn  Fixed horizontal scrolling of text in status window.
rbn  Preserve horizontal and vertical scroll position while 
     updating.  This prevents the display being reset to the
     top line every 5 seconds.
rbn  Fix Windows cross-compile compatibilty problems with 
     *nix variants such as OS X without the zic command.
rbn  Eliminate dependency on man2html.
25Sep06
kes  Update src/win32/dll/bacula.def for change in BPIPE definition for
     Win32 build.                 
kes  Fix a compiler warning in compat.cpp
kes  Change strcpy to bstrncpy in compat.cpp
kes  Remove some broken code in bdb_list.c
kes  Fix, hopefully the last, ACL problem in the restore command.
kes  Update the README.mingw32
kes  Add new version of upgrade-win32-client.txt to examples directory.
     Submitted by Michel Meyers.
kes  Print an INFO message in the job report when a Volume is marked Purged.
rbn  Fixed handling of external program and script execution
     so that the format of the command line is more flexible.
     Now executable path names containing spaces are translated
     to the equivalent short name automatically.  The result is
     passed to cmd.exe with the quotes removed.
24Sep06
kes  Apply the recycle patch from Richard Mortimer.
kes  Convert a few if statements in dev.c to switch statements.
kes  Start using print_errmsg instead of bstrerror().
kes  Print a job message in SD when a job is marked to be canceled.
23Sep06
kes  All code added back. Fixed block.c read/write to loop only 3
     times. This apparently keeps the OS from crashing (at least     
     most of the time).
kes  The kernel bug still persists. Backup something then immediately
     do a bscan on the same tape, and the kernel will crash.     
kes  Simplifed tape open().  It no longer uses nonblocking mode, which 
     means that opening with no tape loaded will probably take at least
     6 minutes before an error is reported.
kes  Do not use MTSETDRVBUFFER if not running as root.  Do a MTRESET
     when doing set_os_device_parameters.
kes  Report open error in mount.c
kes  Remove all .exe files from the installer directory on make clean.
20Sep06
kes  Start adding back removed code.
kes  Back out a number of changes because backups to tape crash my
     system.
kes  Remove the inetd code from the File daemon.
18Sep06
kes  Add -c option to pg_dump so that it initializes tables when   
     restored.
kes  Fix FirstWritten time on Volume to be obtained from SD so that
     it is the actual time the volume was first written.
kes  Minor Makefile changes.
kes  Handle EBUSY during read(). Improve how EBUSY is handled in write().
ebl  Add yes keyword to prune/purge command
16Sep06
kes  Correct a test in block.c that prevented restore of a DVD from
     looking at the last part in the spool directory.
kes  Make some error messages clearer mostly by using the word DVD
     in the message. Improve infor message in read_record for DVDs.
kes  Remove DVD kludges in dircmd.c label/relabel.
kes  Move the dvd relabel code from dircmd.c into      
     write_new_volume_label_to_dvd() adding a relabel argument.
kes  Rewrite the truncate_dvd() code to be much simpler and
     more logical. First blow away any spool part, then create a
     new empty part and write to the DVD.
kes  Rewrite the can_write_on_non_blank_dvd() code making it
     only ensure that no valid data is on the DVD -- i.e. it
     can be overwritten.
15Sep06
kes  Minor Makefile fixes.
kes  Put attach_dcr_to_dev in a subroutine.
kes  Make attaching/detaching to/from a device use a flag and 
     only detach if actually attached.
kes  Add dvd-simulator.in to scripts directory and add to configure.
kes  Fix code in acquire.c that checks fd != 0 to use dev->is_open().  
     This could be a cause of a number of drive reservation problems.
     Note, this code is now in attach_dcr_to_dev().
kes  Suppress doing Volume updates if it is a system job.  This should
     prevent the DVD label blocking.
kes  Clear the freespace ok flag in a couple of strategic places.
14Sep06
kes  Put removing zero sized spool part file in subroutine and
     call from release_device().
kes  Add Richard's patch for relabel to dircmd.c, but save and restore
     dev Volume name.
kes  Rework a lot of subroutines in dev.c to take dcr as an
     argument. This is done to eliminate the usage of attached_dcrs
     in lseek().
kes  Change truncated_dvd to blank_dvd, which seems more suitable.
kes  Apply most of Richard Mortimer's truncate patch.
kes  Create lseek() method for DEVICE that takes dcr as an
     argument. This is to eliminate the use of attached_dcrs in
     lseek().  The calls to lseek_dev() must still be changed.
13Sep06
kes  Apply Richard Mortimer's patches for printing an error 
     message in btape when a DVD is used, and to initialize traceback.
kes  Added error message to btape when trying to access a file.
kes  Move prototype of update_slots() to protos.h.
12Sep06
kes  Add JobErrors, JobFiles, SDJobFiles, SDJobErrors, SDJobStatus,
     and FDJobStatus to the Director Python variables.
kes  Make sure valid argument passed to str_to_utime() where Arno
     had a seg fault.
kes  Apply Richard Mortimer's patch for bcopy, bextract, and bscan.
     I.e. part of two different patches.
11Sep06
kes  Modify disk changer to simulate some of the error conditions
     of mtx-changer.
kes  Make sure the close() call in the SD tools is just before the
     getchar() call.
kes  Implement dir_get_volume_info() in bls using the patch from
     Richard Mortimer but call find_num_dvd_parts().
kes  Implement find_num_dvd_parts() that mounts and scans a DVD
     and counts the parts. 
kes  Move the omode code in open_dvd() up so that the cannot
     write on blank disk can check can be bypassed for read mode.
     Not yet implemented.
10Sep06
kes  Disable normal data spooling for DVD writing which uses  
     a different spooling mechanism.
kes  Apply patch from Richard Mortimer to ensure that the number
     of DVD parts is correctly updated.
rbn  Save installer details log in the Bacula directory as 
     install.log.
rbn  Add installer generation of client and storage templates
     suitable for @inclusion on the director.
rbn  Mark previously installed Win32 components read-only since 
     deselection doesn't do anything.

Version 1.39.22 beta released:
08Sep06
kes  Fix logic error in handling error return from mtx-changer 
     script.
kes  Make status from SD aware of -1 (unknown) Slot status.
kes  At Eric's suggestion make both the 'slots' and 'drive' commands
     to the Storage daemon work even if the drive is busy.
kes  Make two separate Win32 menu links for starting bconsole and
     wx-console in winbacula.nsi
kes  Apply DVD part_spooled patch from Richard Mortimer 
     richm@oldelvet.org.uk 
kes  Put installer/Readme.txt into Win32 EOL format for Notebook.
rbn  Fixed problems migrating settings from previous releases in
     Win32 installer. Add Readme.txt with an option to show it on 
     the installer Finish page.
07Sep06
kes  Use get_catalog_resource() to open catalog database
     to ensure that ACLs are respected and that user is
     correctly prompted for database.
kes  Integrate multiple console/director patch from 
     Carsten Paeth calle@calle.in-berlin.de
ebl  Add character substitution in Job/JobDefs WriteBootStrap.
     You can use now 'WriteBootStrap = '/path/%c_%n.bsr''
kes  Apply patch supplied in bug #656 to pass priority field
     in the run dialog to the Director in gnome console
kes  Restore DCR after VOL_NAME_ERROR in mount.c.  Hopefully
     this will fix bug #627 where Bacula eventually gets 
     confused about what Volume it wants.
kes  Add a new close_part() class in the SD to save the device
     state around open/close_part/open for DVD writing.  This
     should fix the num_dvd_parts getting zeroed as reported by
     Richard Mortimer.
kes  Apply patch from Richard Mortimer that correct edit code
     for debug output of st_size.
ebl  Add support of encrypted data stream to bscan.
     display data_len instead of data content (may be binary)
06Sep06
kes  Add dev->close() in dir_ask_sysop_to_mount_volume() in
     bcopy. Fixes bug #669 reported by Eric.
kes  Fix incorrect number of arguments in SQL statement in
     sql_get.c as reported by Eric.
kes  Manual updates.
kes  Update examples directory.
kes  Remove unused variable in winservice.cpp
kes  Make Win32 make command build installer.
rbn  Add new Install Type page, used to select between Automatic
     and Custom installs.  Automatic installs only prompt for
     configuration items that can't be reasonably defaulted.
rbn  Added Bacula logo to page headers.
rbn  Added Upgrade support
     - Configuration and component selection are migrated from
       pre-1.39 installs.
     - Configuration of upgraded components is preserved and 
       not prompted for
     - Configuration of new components is handled according to
       the Automatic / Custom selection.
     - Component selection is defaulted to previously selected 
       components.
rbn  Installation of Server components is disabled on 
     Windows 95, 98 and ME.
rbn  Added URLs for support, info and upgrades to Bacula entry
     in Add/Remove Programs.
rbn  Added Version info to Bacula entry in Add/Remove Programs.
04Sep06
kes  Correct dvd code that breaks tape labeling.      
kes  Implement Enabled on update slots.
02Sep06
kes  When doing a label, pass the VolBytes back to the Director,
     which puts it in the catalog.
kes  Print an error message if the user attempts to prune an
     archived Volume.
kes  Need to start using %ld when sscanfing 32 bit values.
kes  Update the free
kes  Correct the counting of VolCatBytes for DVDs. 
kes  Add code to mount.c to require that VolCatBytes corresponds to
     what is actually found when doing an append.
kes  Update freespace only after writing on the DVD.
kes  Remove code that blows away the current part in the spool file.
01Sep06
kes  Apply new dvd-handler patch from Richard Mortimer.
kes  Tweak so that debug level 20 shows only DVD commands.
kes  Correct spooled_part flag in dev.c close() so that it is cleared
     when the spool file is deleted or does not exist.
kes  Print part number in read_records when eof hit (restore).
rbn  Installer default changed to start services on new install.
31Aug06
kes  Make find with no args in tree restore return error rather than
     stopping the selection. Fixes bug #665
kes  Rework DVD writing to ensure that the last part is written
     on open_next_part when dealing with a spool file.
kes  Correct the lseek_dev() routine to handle end point correctly
     (bug introduced by me).
kes  Allow part number to exceed num_dvd_parts in lseek_dev().
rbn  Change make_session_key on Windows to use WIN32 APIs to produce 
     a better seed.
rbn  Add new tool scsilist.exe which displays the changer, tape and 
     CD/DVD (1394, SCSI, SATA, ATAPI) devices and the information required 
     to add them to bacula-sd.conf.
30Aug06
kes  Apply dvd-handler patch from Richard Mortimer.
kes  Apply dvd error check patch from Richard Mortimer.
kes  Apply bpipe race patch from Richard Mortimer.
kes  Rework how DVD labels are handled and set append only
     when part > num_dvd_parts.
27Aug06
kes  Rework many features of DVD writing and reading. Added many error
     messages.  Most importantly changed part to represent the current
     part number base zero. This makes current DVD writing incompatible
     with previous version.
26Aug06
kes  Add host:port to connect failure messages to FD and SD from Dir.
kes  Add WhereACL to console ACL list.  If nothing is specified, only
     the default is permitted for restore. Otherwise, *all* allows any
     path, or you can specify permitted paths. This should allow control
     over where users can restore files. This is untested.
kes  Modified message to add a ? (as in loaded?) when querying the autochanger
     for what Slot is loaded.  
kes  Fixed the use of Slot, so that is more correctly maintained, thus
     eliminating unneeded duplicate calls to determine what Slot is loaded.
25Aug06
kes  Install man pages with 'make install'
kes  wx-console crashes because of differences between Bacula and wxWidgets
     malloc()/free().  Tweak wx-console to use bmalloc()/bfree() for Bacula
     calls.     
kes  correct improper indenting in wx-console/console_conf.c
kes  update wx-console header copyrights
kes  Fix bug #658 where wx-console mangles file/directory names containing
     commas.
24Aug06
kes  Add Media.Enabled flag to client backups for dotcmds.c
kes  Enforce Media.Enabled=1 for a current restore to work.
kes  Require restore case 3 to have sqlquery permission to work.
kes  Remove obsolete del_MAC sql command.
kes  Ensure that bscan creates Volumes with Enabled=1.

Version 1.39.20 beta released:
22Aug06
kes  Correct missing Client table reference in SQL pointed out by
     Marc.
21Aug06
kes  Fix Win32 build (new entrypoint, start baculafd).
20Aug06
kes  Add -n option to bconsole to turn off conio.
kes  Print JobIds to be migrated in Job Report.
kes  Add additional user supplied notes to the messages part of 
     bacula-dir.conf concerning multiple email addresses.
kes  Fix an incorrect comment pointed out by a user in dvd_handler.in
kes  Add more recent Feature requests to Projects file.
19Aug06
kes  Apply Maritn's fix to src/win32/Makefile.
kes  Apply Martin's fix to configure.in for pthreads on FreeBSD 4.x
kes  Implement pruning for Migration and migrated jobs.
kes  Implement PoolOccupancy migration.
kes  Implement PoolTime migration.
16Aug06
kes  If doing a mount, look for a slot, and if specified pass it to
     the SD so that it can load the autochanger.
kes  Return DVD=1 flag if a label command is done to a DVD. This
     permits setting VolParts to 1.
kes  Apply DVD patch from Richard Mortimer <richm@oldelvet.org.uk>, but
     rework ua_label code based on DVD media type to use DVD flag returned.
15Aug06
kes  Eliminate some compile warnings in dird_conf.c
kes  Format the bytes field in the terminated jobs part of the status
     command for the three daemons with suffixes to reduce print size 
     of backup bytes.  Suggested by a user.
kes  When not descending into a directory, print the File= name that
     triggered it -- makes why not descending a bit clearer.
kes  Do not unload autochanger when doing a list command -- basic code
     from Eric Bollengier.
12Aug06
rbn  Reworked the MinGW32 build-dependencies script, it has been renamed
     to build-depkgs-mingw32.  It now handles two options -h to display
     help and -C to reextract the source and apply the patches.  The -C
     option is useful for updating the source after new patches are 
     released.
rbn  Moved the 3rd party package URLs to a separate file External-mingw32.
     This allows updating to new versions without having to modify the
     script and makes it easier to figure out which packages and which
     versions are used.
rbn  Added a new script build-depkgs-msvc.cmd which does the same thing
     as build-depkgs-mingw32 except they are built using Microsoft Visual C
     and placed in the depkgs-msvc directory.  There is also an 
     External-msvc file to describe the packages.
08Aug06
rbn  Fix Windows cross-compile compatibilty problems with FreeBSD.
07Aug06
kes  Fix bug #462 incorrect error message printed when client script called
     from File= was not found.
kes  Fix bug #558 (waiting for feedback) where Bacula needs too much time to
     do a rewind on Solaris when no tape is in the drive (Solaris does not
     have the detailed errno found on Linux).  Added Solaris specific code.
     Note, this may apply to other OSes as well.
06Aug06
kes  Defined BUILDING_CATS in src/cats/cats.h so that *nix builds.
dsb  Updated rpm spec for 1.39 - updatedb 9 to 10, add new man pages,
     fix bug 648 - update sqlite script patches, lock out gnome2console
     builds for platforms with gtk+ < 2.4.
     Updated build_rpm.sh - add remote source directory, add switch for 
     signing, refine file names.
     Updated spec file again for Mandriva build as they have this curious
     custom of silently converting all manpages to bzip2 format just before
     the final packaging step.
05Aug06
rbn  Fixed the Windows Makefiles so that they won't accidentally try and
     pickup binaries for the Unix build.  This allows both the Unix
     build and the Windows build to be built in the same tree without
     interfering with each other.
rbn  Fixed error handling and cleaned up mtx-changer.cmd.
rbn  Added the rest of the database scripts.  These are installed but are
     not yet edited for variable replacement.
rbn  Broke out the cats functionality from bacula.dll and put into new
     separate dlls for each database type.  At installation time the
     correct one is copied to bacula_cats.dll.
rbn  Eliminate the need to install the mysql.dll on client only builds.
rbn  Moved dird/sql_cmds.c into the cats directory so all the database
     specific #ifdefs were in the cats directory.
rbn  Added a new sql_cmds.h with all the declarations for the variables
     exported from sql_cmds.c.

kes  Make make clean descend into the src/win32 directory.
kes  Fix some #ifdefing so that Solaris and FreeBSD compile 
     sys/stat.h was turned off.
kes  Use suffix editing for new transfer rate messages.
kes  Attempt to come up with a workaround which seems to be an OS
     bug where write() returns EBUSY.  IMO this should not happen.
     It triggered in truncatebug test. The workaround retries using
     a 100 ms wait.
kes  Eliminate a strerror() call in a class method that failed with

Version 1.39.18
29Jul06
kes  Incremented the version number to signify that all of Robert's code
     for Win32 that was in the branch is now integrated into the HEAD,
     and that Eric has submitted code that we hope will provide limited
     backward compatibility with 1.38 file daemons (more testing to be
     done).
kes  I rationalized a few of the names of the variables (mainly jcr names)
     that are used during migration as keeping three different jcrs at the
     same time clear in ones head is not easy.

Version 1.39.17
28Jul06

27Jul06
kes  Several important commits from Robert Nelson for code cleanup and
     Win32 build.
kes  Modify console.c so that when conio is enabled, it converts \n to
     \n\r before outputting to the console.  Hopefully this will fix
     the problems with expect in Perl that Eric saw.
24Jul06
kes  Change cats/sql.c to eliminate %-*s format, which I think is turned
     off in bsnprintf.

09Jul06
kes  Modify read_record and friends to properly deal with migration         
     needs.
kes  Update debug code in read_record.       
08Jul06
     ======================= Warning ==========================
     Separate read and write storage in Jobs in the Director. This
     is a major rewrite of some of the low level code and hence has
     a high probability of introducing bugs.
     ==========================================================

kes  Move the job init code up to *before* the job is put into
     the job queue (resource allocation queue). This permits the
     job to establish whether it will read or write or do both.
kes  Add name() methods to all the resource classes.
kes  Implement separate read and write storage resource 
     allocation/deallocation in jobq.c

     ======================= Warning ==========================
     Implemented new method of getting the default Storage from the Media
     record rather than from the MediaType for restore.  As a fall
     back, if no Storage is defined, use the MediaType.  This
     eliminates most all prompts if there are multiple MediaTypes
     used. This is an important and fundamental change.
     ==========================================================

kes  Add more detail (Storage, Device) to list of volumes printed
     for restore.
kes  More code in migrate. In particular start multiple jobs if
     migrating a volume.
kes  Probably overkill, but ensure that the bsr is unique even within a 
     job in FD and SD.
kes  Rework bsys.c drop() so that it now should work as expected.
kes  Update a bunch of old copyrights -kes  particularly in .h files.
kes  Remove src/lib/bshm.c/h
05Jul06
kes  Migration fixes
04Jul06
     ======================= Warning ==========================
        All hash codes in the database are now kept in world
        compatible base64 format (no = filling). This means that
        all FileSets will be updated and if you are running
        verify jobs, you must do an InitCatalog.
        Authentication uses the new algorithm, but should be
        backward compatible with 1.38.x
     ===========================================================

kes  Modify the authentication routines so that the 1.39.15 Director
     always runs with the compatible binary to base64 code (same as
     the rest of the world).  It will however detect if an SD or
     FD is running the old code and if that is the case, will use
     the old algorithm for authentication.  However, all consoles must
     use the compatible algorithm, and all data entered into the database
     (all hash signatures, MD5, SHA1, ..., and all FileSet hashes) will
     use the compatible algorithm.
kes  Rename the cram_md5 routine names to be slightly more appropriate
     to what they are doing (challenge and respond).
kes  Robert committed his #ifdef and header cleanup.
30Jun06
kes  Fix a compiler warning in files/backup.c
kes  Cleanup NOT NULL vs DEFAULT 0 in database creation.
kes  Tweak btape.
kes  Robert committed his low impact changes.

kes  Update the tape regression scripts (still to be tested).
kes  Add gcc and gcc-c++ requires to srm as suggested by a user.
kes  Require done or quit to exit from in memory tree restore.
26Jun06
kes  Write install/uninstall of new manpages. There are now a
     pile of man pages. Some of which need a lot of work.

     ======================= Warning ==========================
        The --mandir ./configure option now points to the top level
        man directory.  The man files will be installed under
        mandir/man8 and mandir/man1 as appropriate.
     ==========================================================

kes  Add complete text of GPL to LICENSE.
kes  Implement job report that indicates where Storage and Pool
     came from -kes  with overrides and Pool storage and NextPool,
     it is all very complicated.
kes  Create a few common subroutines for backup.c and migrate.c
kes  Eliminate warning messages from tray-monitor.c
25Jun06
kes  Apply fix for scheduler for missing unlock_jobs().
kes  Clean out autoconf caches before rebuilding configure

kes  Add missing semicolon in src/console/console.c
kes  Add Robert's enhanced version of build-win32-cross-tools
     as well as his patch file.
kes  Note, the new gcc options are likely to break building of
     wx-console or the tray-monitor ...
24Jun06
kes  Implement Robert's suggestion to suppress printing compile lines.
kes  Detect GCC correctly (I hope)
kes  If using GCC (actually g++) add the following compiler flags
     -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti

     ===================== Warning =============================
     Turn on new bsnprintf() code.  This could cause print output
     to look different.
     ===========================================================

kes  Fix crypto when not using openssl. I previously overlooked this.
kes  Eliminate crypto type punning problems by eliminating void * and
     using uint8_t * instead.
kes  Harden authentication failure in FD by single threading errors
     and forcing a 6 second wait.

     ===================== Warning =============================
          Removed  'Accept Any Volume' directive.
     ===========================================================

kes  Major cleanup and simplification of regress using shell functions
     (more tests to be converted to new format)   
kes  Add detection of 64 bit Irix as indicated by user.
kes  Increment catalog database id from 9 to 10.
kes  Add a few of the new database fields to the various C++
     structures.
kes  Implement code to fill in the most important new fields (e.g.
     Media Enable).
kes  Ensure that most of the new fields are in create/get/insert/update.
     More work to be done.
22Jun06
kes  Update some very old licenses in src/cats.
kes  Modify the database format for handling Migration jobs:
      Add PriorJobId, RealEndTime to Job table
      Delete MAC table
      Remove Stripe from JobMedia record (not used, wasting space)
      Add ScratchPoolId, RecyclePoolId, Enabled to Media record
      Add Cost to Location table.
kes  Delete mac_record subroutines.
kes  Add new table values to create/update/get routines as appropriate.
kes  Update the update_tables and make_tables scripts.
kes  Make a first cut in using a union where multiple pointers (actually
     pointers to pointers) are stored.
kes  Make some changes to base64.c suggested by Robert and others and add
     a small amount of documentation.
kes  Add some changes suggested by Peter for Solaris (bregex...)
kes  Make runscript.h always built because it needs to be pulled into
     more places.  In particular its RES was left out of a union.
kes  Renumber the enum{} list in runscript.h to avoid starting from zero.
     This makes it slightly easier to detect uninitialized variables.
14Jun06
kes  Remove xpg4 lib from FreeBSD build as it is no longer needed and
     sometimes creates install problems.
kes  Change a couple of %T in strftime to %H:%M:%S as seen in Robert
     Nelson's code.  More to do.
kes  Convert a few store_bit to store_bool in filed_conf.c.       
kes  DVD tweak to block.c as supplied by Uwe Muessel.
04Jun06
kes  Modify configure.in to check for typeof().
kes  In findlib/attribs.c use typeof instead of templates if possible.
01Jun06
kes  Implement partial error messages for src/filed/acl.c
kes  Fix return code to fail when doing update barcodes and
     Pool resource is not found. This previously caused Volumes
     to be labeled as cleaning tapes.
kes  Small updates to projects.
27May06
kes  Add Eric Bollengier patch for new RunScript directive. It breaks
     compatibility between dird and fd.
26May06

kes  Integrate manpages contributed by Jose Luis.
kes  Update projects file.
kes  Add manpages Makefile.in to configure.in
kes  Remove installation of bacula.8 in scripts directory.
24May06
kes  Implement patch submitted by cesarb in bug #606 to implement O_NOATIME
     support.
       O_NOATIME is a open() flag which makes it possible to read a file without
       updating the inode atime (and also without the inode ctime update which
       happens if you try to set the atime back to its previous value). It also
       prevents a race condition when two programs are reading the same file, but
       only one does not want to change the atime. It's most useful for backup
       programs and file integrity checkers (and bacula can fit on both
       categories).

       Recent versions of the Linux kernel and glibc have support for it (the
       glibc support being mostly copying the O_NOATIME definition to
       bits/fcntl.h). If there's no support for it on the kernel, trying to use
       it does nothing (since the kernel ignores unknown flags).

       If the kernel has support for it, trying to use it either works, fails
       silently (mostly in remote filesystems), or returns errno=EPERM (if you
       are not either the owner of the file or root). A simple way to prevent the
       failure is to open the file without the flag and set it later with
       fcntl(F_SETFL), ignoring any EPERM errors.
kes  Applied patch posted by Jaime Ventura to bug #570 to correct failure
     of restarted jobs to complete (due to a destroyed pthreads conditional
     variable used by the message thread).
kes  Fixed bug #619 where Bacula would not restart jobs with MaxRestartTimes
     set to zero. 
kes  Apply patch from John Goerzen bug #611 to fix bad manual links in the code.
kes  Apply patch from Rudolf Cejka bug #614 to removed trailing
     colons in query.sql file.
kes  Apply patch from Rudolf Cejka bug #613 to correct prunning of files
     not to create orphans.
kes  Apply patch from Rudolf Cejka bug #617 to use mtime instead of ctime
     in restore long listing.
kes  Apply patch from Rudolf Cejka bug #609 to use MarkId in verify.c instead
     of incorrect MarkedId.
kes  Apply patch from adioso bug #616 to correct text in manual (replace
     Director with File daemon).
kes  Rework a few of the zlib changes so that they build properly.

21May06
kes  Move DIR 'run' command to SD before starting the message thread
     as suggested by Cristopher Hull to avoid a race deadlock from
     two threads using the bsock structure.
kes  Modify LICENSE to correct some problems pointed out by Debian.
05May06

     started adding Makefile ...
kes  Moved MinGW library objects to src/win32/lib to reduce clutter.
30Apr06
kes  Reloading a bad configuration file doesn't kill director any more.
     Thanks to fix from Eric Bollengier.
29Apr06
kes  Fix problem of accents with new Win32 code.
kes  Integrate Howard's VSS patch. Tweak it a bit. VSS now
     works in the MinGW build with the exception that there
     is a problem with accented characters -kes  i.e. there is
     some mapping problem with wide characters.
kes  The code no longer compiles with Microsoft VC++.
28Apr06
kes  Start implementing Christopher's St.Bernard code.
kes  Add Christopher's mods for opening files.
kes  Strip \r \n from Win32 error messages (Christopher)
kes  Add more info about Win32 system if unknown (Christopher)
kes  Use bstrn(cpy, cat) routines to avoid overrun in compat.cpp
kes  Fix a number of incorrect strings marked for translation, when
     they should not be (e.g. commands).
kes  Fix StartTime bug reported for ClientRunBeforeJob and RunBeforeJob
     Patches supplied by user in bugs #608 and #599.
kes  Use most recent of st_ctime and st_mtime in restore tree DIR
     listing. This fixes some problems with Win32 printing incorrect
     values.
kes  Correct the clock shift comm time calculation between the DIR
     and the FD. It was added rather than subtracted.
kes  Strip all backslashes in filenames to be restored on Win32
     machines -kes  the names should all be in Unix format, and if
     there are any backslashes it is most likely due to an improper
     FileSet definition, and the files will not otherwise be 
     restorable.
kes  Remove lib/regex.c (replaced by bregex.c).
kes  Delete src/win32/License.txt
kes  Modify installer to install LICENSE
26Apr06

kes  Add back ua_label barcode fix from Rufolf Cejka.
kes  Integrate the majority of the Mingw cross-tools submission
     made by Howard Thomson. Everything compiles, with zlib, openssl,
     and VSS turned off. Linking needs a pthreads library ...
23Apr06

kes  More work on migration.
kes  Restore non-compatible base64 coding to permit compatibility.
kes  Display heap stats in Storage daemon without debug level.

21Apr06
kes  Implement using pg_config for finding PostgreSQL files.
     Fixes bug #600. Patch supplied by user.
kes  Remove -t option from mktemp in mtx_changer.in and use
     working directory. Fixes bug #578.
kes  Update job start time after the any run before job so that
     files created by the script are only backed up once. Fixes
     bug #599.
kes  Strip trailing newline only from filenames entered in
     the restore command when reading a file. This permits
     the user to enter filenames with trailing spaces. Fixes
     bug #549. The user supplied a patch that I modified slightly.
kes  Use the most recent time (st_mtime, st_ctime) in the dir
     command in restore. This gives the user a better idea of what
     the newest file really is. This fixes bug #574. The fix
     was suggested by the user.
kes  Implement a compatible version of base64. This permits external
     programs to duplicate Bacula's base64 algorithm using standard
     routines. This fixes bugs #296, and 565. Patch submitted by   
     author of bug #565.  
     ================= Note ========================
     Previous Signatures stored in the database are no longer
     compatible with this. The main downside is for Verify jobs,
     and doing an InitCatalog run will fix the problem. Also, the
     authentication between the deamons is changed, so all daemons
     must be simultaneously upgraded.
     ==============================================
     If you don't like this fix, set:
       const bool compatible = true;
     to
       const bool compatible = false;
     in src/lib/base64.c

     list volumes known to the Storage device, and the other
     lists volumes possibly needing replacement (error, ...).
15Jan06
kes  Add periodic (every 24 hours) garbage collection of memory 
     pool by releasing free buffers.
14Jan06
kes  Correct bug counting sized (for display only) in smartall.c
kes  Print FD mempool stats if debug > 0 rather than 5.
12Jan06
kes  Make db_lock() mutex error fail the job rather than abort
     Bacula.  Canceling the job caused the mutex to fail.
kes  Correct bug in alist.c that re-allocated the list if the
     number of items goes to zero.
kes  Move the reservation system thread locking to the top level
     so that one job at a time tries all possible drives before
     waiting.
kes  Implement a reservation 'fail' message queue that is built            
     and destroyed on each pass through the reservation system.
     These messages are displayed in a 'Jobs waiting to reserve
     a drive' list during a 'status storage='.  Note, multiple
     messages will generally print for each JobId because they
     represent the different problems with either the same drive
     or different drives.  If this output proves too confusing
     of voluminous, I will display it only when debug level 1
     or greater is enabled in the SD.
11Jan06
kes  Add enable/disable job=<job-name>.     This command prevents
     the specified job from being scheduled. Even when disabled,
     the job can be manually started from the console.
kes  During 'update slots' clear all InChanger flags where the
     StorageId is zero (old Media records).

Beta release 1.38.4:
09Jan06
kes  Fix autochanger code to strip leading spaces from returned
     slots number. Remove bc from chio-changer.
kes  Back port a bit of 1.39 crypto code to reduce diffs.
kes  Fix first call to autochanger that missed close()ing the
     drive. Put close() just before each run_program().  Fixes
     Arno's changer bug.
07Jan06
kes  Add PoolId to Job record when updating it at job start time.
06Jan06
kes  Pull in more code from 1.39 so that there are fewer file
     differences (the new ua_dotcmds.c, base64.h, crypto.h
     hmac.c jcr.c (dird and lib) lib.h md5.h parse_conf.c 
     util.c. Aside from ua_dotcmds.c these are mostly crypto
     upgrades.
kes  Implement new method of walking the jcr chain. The
     incr/dec of the use_count is done within the walking
     routines.  This should prevent a jcr from being freed
     from under the walk routines.


Changes to 1.39.3:
04Jan06
kes  Start implementing Verify list output.
kes  Move the suitable_drive flag to a better place to prevent

26Dec05
kes  Add mutex to single thread VSS code in Win32.
22Dec05

     code.
kes  Modify the wait code to permit multiple returns.
kes  Return a zero when 'autochanger drives' is called and
     it is not an autochanger.
kes  Make rewind_dev() a method taking a DCR as an argument.
     This permits closing and reopening the drive if the
     rewind fails as happens if the drive was loaded while the
     file descriptor was open. This refreshes the file descriptor.
kes  Remove the ST_OPENED flag and always rely on fd < 0 for knowing
     if the device is open or not.  This should eliminate
     Arnos problem.
kes  Return error if reserve cannot find at least one suitable device.
kes  Make wait_for_sysop() return correct state information.
kes  Fix Win32 state file problem. write was not using compat
     code. This should fix bug #500.
21Dec05
kes  Modify gui on command to set only GUI mode and not batch.
kes  Modify .messages command to always print messages regardless
     of the mode.
kes  If GUI mode is on, suppress automatic printing of 
     You have messages. 
kes  Delete old bnet packet code.
kes  Ignore new BNET_START_SELECT and BNET_END_SELECT signals in
     wx-console. -kes  not implemented because bconsole must be updated.
kes  Modify restore command in wx-console to set gui on and to use
     only .messages instead of messages.  Hopefully this fixes bug
     #514.
kes  Fix seg fault in exit of acquire when canceling a job --
     reported by Wolfgang Denk
kes  Pull in latest reservation system changes from 1.38
kes  Make .messages command always print messages regardless

     command.
kes  Updates to ssh-tunnel from Joshua Kugler.
kes  Added a report.pl program from Jonas Bjorklund.               
kes  Simplify the O_NONBLOCK open() code for tape drives,
     and always open nonblocking.
kes  Do not wait for open() if EIO returned (shouldn't happen).
kes  Eliminate 3 argument to tape open().
kes  Correct the slot # edited in the 3995 Bad autochanger unload
     message.
kes  With -S on bscan (show progress) do not divide by zero.
13Dec05
kes  Make cancel pthread_cond_signal() pthread_cond_broadcast().
kes  When dcr is freed, also broadcast dev->wait_next_vol signal.
kes  Remove unused code in wait_for_device.     
kes  Make wait_for_device() always return after 60 seconds of wait.

     and partial records in read_record().  This allows bscan
     to get FileIndex at EOT correct.
kes  Fix butil.c to correctly set dcr -kes  fixes seg fault in bls.
08Dec05
kes  Fix Win32 built to work with new crypto code.
kes  Apply patch supplied by user (slightly modified) to fix
     correct detection of holes in block devices and FIFOs. 
     Bug # 506.

     IP. Fixes bug # 508.
07Dec05
kes  Add nagios plugin to the examples directory. Submitted by
     Christian Masopust.
kes  Remove warning message about multiple saves of hardlinked files
     from find_one.c as it can generate too many warning messages.
kes  Modify most restore error messages to be queued so that they
     appear at the end of the job rather than mixted with the restore
     listing where they could be 'lost'.
06Dec05
kes  Reset timeout values before select() per patch from 
     Frank Sweetser for problems with non-blocking sockets.
kes  Unlink the state file if either reading or writing it gets
     errors.  Hopefully this will fix Win32 exit problems.
kes  Add sanity check in append.c to ensure that dcr is not NULL.
     This can happen if multiple drive autochanger SCSI control
     channel and drive indicies do not correspond.
05Dec05

     If this patch is applied, the number of days can be specified with
     'list nextvol days=xx'
     or
     'status dir days=xx'
     My use case is to be able to preview the next scheduled job (and the 
     next tape to be used) on fridays if there are no scheduled jobs during 
     the weekend.
