              Technical notes on version 2.1

General:
29Mar07
kes  Implement dir_sql() which issues an SQL query.
kes  Modify bat medialist to use dir_sql() and do some minor C++
     formatting as well as eliminating a number of pointers, simplifing
     the code.
28Mar07
kes  Fix some of the mtx-changer grep commands for tape label readers.
kes  Convert a number of bsendmsg into the appropriate send/warning/error
     message class calls.
kes  Suppress the using database message in the .sql command.
kes  Correct an incorrect bnet_tls_client prototype -- patch from Martin.
27Mar07
kes  Add context menu for floating a window.
kes  Some minor cleanup and name changes in qt-console
kes  Add doing mt setblk 0 in Win32 mtx-changer.
kes  Apply Martin's bug fix to move definition of ENODATA for 
     FreeBSD to bsock.c
ebl  Add a BUSY handler to sqlite to be able to use multi_db = 1 with
     sqlite2 and sqlite3.
26Mar07
kes  More pruning cleanup.
kes  Turn on wait_for_drive by default in mtx-changer.
kes  Turn on Batch insert code by default as it now passes regression.
kes  Add ./configure --enable-bat to enable building of Bat.   
     No install yet though.
25Mar07
kes  Implement a new .sql command for bat.
kes  Implement code to turn off pruning in obtaining the next volume.
     Pruning is turned off for the status dir command, but turned on
     for SD requests and for the list nextvolume command.
24Mar07
kes  Correct Qmsg() that was not updated correctly when committing a
     previous change (probably the recent TLS patch).
23Mar07
kes  Write new subroutine is_volume_purged() that explicitly checks
     if the Volume is purged, and if so marks it as such. This should
     resolve problems reported about needing to mount twice to recycle
     volumes.
kes  Rewrite pruning algorithm to do more work in the SQL engine, and
     to pass a list of JobIds to be deleted to SQL.  Also, minimize the
     amount of duplicated code.     
kes  Do volume pruning only for the Media Type desired (reduces pruning time
     if multiple Media Types are in the same pool).
kes  Implement more detailed info in the Job report for the Bacula version
     and architecture.
kes  Switch from POOLMEM to POOL_MEM (a real class) in ua_prune.c and
     ua_purge.c.
ebl  Add bbatch tool to bench database and insert mode.
     Fix sql quote stuff in batch mode
     Fix sql stuff for mysql
22Mar07
kes  Correct problems with am/pm scheduling. Fixes bug #808.
kes  Implement new prunning code that prunes up to 1000 jobs at
     the same time.  The same technique can be applied to a number
     of other prune/purge subroutines.
kes  Add an insanity check when starting a new tape job to ensure
     that the tape position has not been changed. If so fail the
     job.
kes  Fix Win32 build for dlls to add the folllowing:
     src/lib/bsock.c -- new file with new entry points
     src/lib/dlist.c  -- new entry points
     src/cats/sql_create.c -- new entry point
     src/cats/sql_cmds.c -- new DATA item exported
21Mar07
ebl  batch mode cleanup bscan-test is ok now.
kes  Implement SD code to check length of disk volume before appending.
18Mar07
kes  Correct return status on db_batch... routines.
kes  Add call to db_write_batch_file_records() to migration code.
ebl  Fix AfterJob timing
kes  Move the checking of the database in initializion of the Director
     to after we drop privileges.  This avoids the need for both root
     and bacula access to the DB.
kes  Correct a misplaced variable definition in src/filed/backup.c
kes  Correct how the new batch insert db_create_attributes_record()
     uses the arguments.  Caused a seg fault in bscan.
kes  Implement lock() and unlock() methods in DEVICE class.
     Implement block() and set_block(xx) methods in DEVICE class.
kes  Modify bnet_connect() so that it uses time() to check for the
     wait time expiring (on some OSes, some system calls may not
     return immediately).
kes  Modify Verify to obtain the previous JobId when it is actually
     running rather than at schedule time (as it was in 1.38.x).     
kes  Fix src/job.c to handle MaxWaitTime correctly.  This should
     fix bug #802.
kes  When checking pid in pid file, continue running if the pid is
     the same as ours. This occurs on IRIX after a system crash.
     Fixes bug #797.
10Mar07
kes  Extend new GUI API.
kes  Make the ua structure a class, and implement send_msg(),
     error_msg(), warning_msg(), and info_msg().
08Mar07
kes  Apply fix from for building wx-console on the Mac from
     bug #798.
kes  Implement new select mechanism for GUI programs.
kes  Reorganize initialization of stackedWidgets in bat.
07Mar07
kes  Add updated nagios plugin supplied by Christian Masopust.
05Mar07
kes  More bat implementation.
kes  File migrate bug with Pool Occupancy using mediaid instead
     of jobids.  Fixes bug #795.
kes  Fix orphaned buffers in filed backup and verify due to
     crypto buffers not freed during errors.  Fixes bug #789.
kes  Extend new GUI api code to tree commands.
kes  Ensure that tree and dot commands check console ACLs.
kes  Permit marking directory with trailing slash.
kes  Allow 20 console connections (instead of only 10).
04Mar07
kes  Add smartctl call to bacula-sd.conf as an example of getting
     tape alert info.
02Mar07
kes  Modify jobq.c to let simultaneous restore jobs run. This may 
     cause them to fail if they cannot get a drive.
kes  Add Client Connect Wait to Storage daemon to permit users to
     modify the time the SD waits for a FD connection.
29Feb07
kes  Correct virtual changer check which was backwards. This caused
     volumes to be unloaded into slots already occupied.
28Feb07
kes  Apply Command ACL filter to JobId list in restore command.
kes  Correct typeo in var.c patch.
27Feb07
kes  Don't let Bacula prune File or Job records for the current Job.
kes  Fix variable substitution pad + inc bug reported (with patch)
     in bug #791.
26Feb07
kes  Correct SQLite log table index as reported by Luca Berra.
24Feb07
ebl  fix fifo stuff, bacula tries to rewind the fifo... Thanks to Andreas
22Feb07
kes  Begin implementing new comm signals for API.
kes  Fix a few places in lib/message.c where the open fd may 
     not be zeroed.
kes  Continue implementing lib/bsock.c (real class).  Make jcr,
     who, host, and port private. There are new methods to access
     them for non-class use. This required touching a number of files.
21Feb07
kes  Add LANG=C to autoconf/randpass so it works with languages other
     than English.  Fixes bug #788.
20Feb07
ebl  Revert ClientRunBeforeJob to old position as in 1.38.X.
     This fixes bug #780
     You will not be able to generate Include/Exclude list any more.
     It will be fixed soon.
     If you want to use this, you can apply
     trunk/bacula/patches/testing/clientrunbeforejob_can_generate_include_exclude_list.patch
19Feb07
kes  Restore of sockets created false error messages because Bacula
     no longer restores sockets, but the code was still trying to
     set the attributes on a non-existent file. Reported by a user.
ebl  finish RecyclePool feature
     Media will takes Pool.RecyclePool
     when moving from Scratch to a Pool or when user will do
     update volume=xxx frompool
     To use it, add RecyclePool = aPool to your Pool resource
        Pool {
                Name = Default
                RecyclePool = Scratch
                ...
        }
     TODO: update manual
kes  Expand new BSOCK class adding signal() and new BNET signals.
kes  Begin enhancing the dot commands adding a new API function
     that returns more information and will make it easier
     to interface to the Director from a program.
18Feb07
kes  Make DEVICE fd private. Its new name is m_fd, and can be
     obtained with dev->fd() outside the class.  This is the
     first of many DEVICE members to be made private.
kes  Implement Michael Renner's idea on having a virtual disk
     changer. I made some minor modifications (e.g. I did not
     implement the Virtual Changer directive, but simply set
     the Changer Command to an empty string.
17Feb07
kes  Implement a BSOCK send() method that writes the whole record
     in a single write() request rather than in two.
ebl  add update volume=xxx recyclepool=yyyy
     volume takes recyclepool from pool when using update volume=xxx from pool
16Feb07
kes  Fix encryption deblocking bug, which caused some restored files
     to be truncated. This fixes bug #763.
kes  Add FD event sequence order prepared by Eric -- for RunScripts.
kes  Fix 12am/pm bug as reported in bug #782.
13Feb07
kes  Apply Eric's ClientRunScriptAfter patch to 2.0 and 2.1.
ebl  Use btime_t instead of uint64_t in media patch.
11Feb07
kes  Optimize the use of the database a bit in the Status dir command.
     Only open it when needed, ensure that if any previous database
     was opened, it is closed.
10Feb07
kes  Correct VolCatBytes bug from media patch.
kes  Apply patch from bug #612 by Rudolf Cejka to speedup pruning
     in the case of orphaned records.
kes  Modify dbcheck to handle orphaned JobMedia, Path, Filename,
     and File records in 300K chunks to be more efficient. This
     idea came from Juan Luis Frances (if I remember right).
kes  Apply Eric's scratch patch that moves a purged Volume to
     the RecyclePool.  Question: how is RecyclePool set? what
     happens to the ScratchPool?
kes  Apply Eric's media patch that collects read/write media
     times as well as byte counts.  This patch requires a
     simultaneous upgrade of the DIR and SD.  Note, there
     should be some way to turn off timing. I'm not sure
     times are in Bacula units.
kes  Apply Eric's batch-insert patch.
09Feb07
kes  Update projects list.
08Feb07
kes  Implement Include/Exclude file lists in FD as dlists using
     the new dlistString class. This permits efficiently having
     large include/exclude lists and completes project Item 25.
kes  Fix dird/ua_cmds.c so that a cancel command checks if the
     console is authorized to cancel the job.  This fixes bug 
     #767.
kes  Modify SD so that the VolCatJobs medium record is updated
     at the beginning of a Job rather than the end.  This
     fixes bug #775 where exceeding MaxVolJobs caused jobs
     to fail.
kes  Added a mutex around getting and setting Volume information
     so that multiple simultaneous jobs will single thread.
07Feb07
     Switch to using Subversion
kes  Remove src/pygtk-console/ from configure
06Feb07
kes  Delete src/lib/btree.c from win32 build, then add rblist.c
     plus the entrypoints.
kes  Apply patch supplied that corrects debug print
     in canceling jobs for max run time.  Supplied as
     part of bug #621, which was previously fixed.
05Feb07
kes  Test on job_canceled() and sd_msg_thread_done inside
     loop starting the message thread to avoid a race condition.
     Fixes bug #771.
kes  Remove rl_catch_signal from console.c as it conflicted
     with the header definition. Fixes bug #765.
ebl  Fixes bug #766 about RunsOnClient = Yes (case sensitive)
04Feb07
kes  Clarify some stored/acquire messages to indicate if the
     problem is with read or append.
02Feb07
kes  Fix memory leak with storage ids in cats/sql_get.c
kes  Terminate watchdog earlier to avoid reference to released
     memory -- reported by Jason Austin.
kes  Move closing the database from jobq.c to the director daemon
     termination routine. This fixes memory leaks for shadow jobs
     (i.e. migration jobs).
kes  Free up the unique jobid chain items in migrate.c.  This fixes
     a memory leak problem.
kes  Convert some ugly looking for statements to use foreach_alist
     in findlib/find.c.  This will facilitate converting the structures
     to use dlist (for large include/exclude lists).
kes  Fix a bug in the btree.c and btree.h routines, then rename them
     rblist and add them to be built in src/lib.  Include some new
     methods written by Rudolf Cejka that make the code more readable
     (hides some of the ugly casting).
kes  Add set_next() and set_prev() methods which make the code much more 
     readable. Also add a new dlistString class that facilitates storing
     strings in dlists.  To be used in the large include/exclude lists.
kes  Make some trivial modifications to lib/tree.h that use rblist
     rather than dlist for storing the tree links. This was suggested
     by Rudolf Cejka.  The result of this is that the restore tree now
     uses red-black binary trees rather than simple linked lists. This
     should give rather dramatic speed improvements for directories
     contining large numbers of directories/files (more than 10000).
28Jan07 
kes  Fix maxruntime bug #621.
26Jan07
ebl  Implement the include JobID in spool file name project.
kes  Reorder projects file in order determined by Jan 2007 vote.
kes  Implement item #12 on project list -- quick release of FD by
     the SD.
kes  Fix open of SQLite3 db where user does not have write permission
     so that DIR does not crash. Fixes bug #761.
25Jan07
kes  Add back missing @ in Win32 Makefile.
kes  Change 'Device not configured to autolabel' from INFO
     to WARNING.
kes  Fix jobq.c to restart failed jobs when Reschedule Times = 0 
     which should restart an indefinite # of times.
kes  Fix configure --help to print --with-mysql[=DIR]. Same for
     other DIR specifications.
23Jan07
rn   Fix msvc build problems. Fix bacula.dll exports for msvc build.
     Fix path quoting in SQLite scripts.
     Fix problems with SHGetFolderPath.
19Jan07
kes  Create patches/2.0.1-restart.patch. Fixes bug #755.
18Jan07
kes  Fix Job restart on error bug that promotes an Inc to a Full
     backup.  This should fix bug #755.
kes  Add qt-console and first cut of code.

Version 2.0.1
12Jan07
kes  Fix Bacula->Documentation link on Win32 to point to index.html
     instead of bacula.html. Fixed bug #750.
kes  Return JobId in db_get_job_record() when JobId==0. This should
     fix bug #741.
kes  Do not release source pointers when restarting a failed job.
11Jan07
kes  Add dynamic dll entry point for SHGetFolderPath to Win32 code.
     This *should* fix bug #747.
kes  Modify winbacula.nsi to substitute with g bin_dir_cmd. Should fix
     bug #742.
09Jan07
kes  Modify USTORE constructor to set an empty store_source string, 
     and don't copy the store_source string in a cancel.  Hopefully
     this will fix Arno's seg fault, bug #744.
kes  Add back code to disable conio in configure. Fixes bug #743.
kes  Correct the Options scanner in the FD to correctly handle  
     SHA1 option, which was eating the next option.  Reported by    
     Sebastien Guilbaud.
kes  Add code to indicate when the SD is spooling, spool wait, and 
     despooling as requested by Alan Brown.

Version 2.0.0 released: 4 January 2007
