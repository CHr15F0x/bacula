              Technical notes on version 2.1

General:
13Feb07
ebl  Use btime_t instead of uint64_t in media patch.
11Feb07
kes  Optimize the use of the database a bit in the Status dir command.
     Only open it when needed, ensure that if any previous database
     was opened, it is closed.
10Feb07
kes  Correct VolCatBytes bug from media patch.
kes  Apply patch from bug #612 by Rudolf Cejka to speedup pruning
     in the case of orphaned records.
kes  Modify dbcheck to handle orphaned JobMedia, Path, Filename,
     and File records in 300K chunks to be more efficient. This
     idea came from Juan Luis Frances (if I remember right).
kes  Apply Eric's scratch patch that moves a purged Volume to
     the RecyclePool.  Question: how is RecyclePool set? what
     happens to the ScratchPool?
kes  Apply Eric's media patch that collects read/write media
     times as well as byte counts.  This patch requires a
     simultaneous upgrade of the DIR and SD.  Note, there
     should be some way to turn off timing. I'm not sure
     times are in Bacula units.
kes  Apply Eric's batch-insert patch.
09Feb07
kes  Update projects list.
08Feb07
kes  Implement Include/Exclude file lists in FD as dlists using
     the new dlistString class. This permits efficiently having
     large include/exclude lists and completes project Item 25.
kes  Fix dird/ua_cmds.c so that a cancel command checks if the
     console is authorized to cancel the job.  This fixes bug 
     #767.
kes  Modify SD so that the VolCatJobs medium record is updated
     at the beginning of a Job rather than the end.  This
     fixes bug #775 where exceeding MaxVolJobs caused jobs
     to fail.
kes  Added a mutex around getting and setting Volume information
     so that multiple simultaneous jobs will single thread.
07Feb07
     Switch to using Subversion
kes  Remove src/pygtk-console/ from configure
06Feb07
kes  Delete src/lib/btree.c from win32 build, then add rblist.c
     plus the entrypoints.
kes  Apply patch supplied that corrects debug print
     in canceling jobs for max run time.  Supplied as
     part of bug #621, which was previously fixed.
05Feb07
kes  Test on job_canceled() and sd_msg_thread_done inside
     loop starting the message thread to avoid a race condition.
     Fixes bug #771.
kes  Remove rl_catch_signal from console.c as it conflicted
     with the header definition. Fixes bug #765.
ebl  Fixes bug #766 about RunsOnClient = Yes
04Feb07
kes  Clarify some stored/acquire messages to indicate if the
     problem is with read or append.
02Feb07
kes  Fix memory leak with storage ids in cats/sql_get.c
kes  Terminate watchdog earlier to avoid reference to released
     memory -- reported by Jason Austin.
kes  Move closing the database from jobq.c to the director daemon
     termination routine. This fixes memory leaks for shadow jobs
     (i.e. migration jobs).
kes  Free up the unique jobid chain items in migrate.c.  This fixes
     a memory leak problem.
kes  Convert some ugly looking for statements to use foreach_alist
     in findlib/find.c.  This will facilitate converting the structures
     to use dlist (for large include/exclude lists).
kes  Fix a bug in the btree.c and btree.h routines, then rename them
     rblist and add them to be built in src/lib.  Include some new
     methods written by Rudolf Cejka that make the code more readable
     (hides some of the ugly casting).
kes  Add set_next() and set_prev() methods which make the code much more 
     readable. Also add a new dlistString class that facilitates storing
     strings in dlists.  To be used in the large include/exclude lists.
kes  Make some trivial modifications to lib/tree.h that use rblist
     rather than dlist for storing the tree links. This was suggested
     by Rudolf Cejka.  The result of this is that the restore tree now
     uses red-black binary trees rather than simple linked lists. This
     should give rather dramatic speed improvements for directories
     contining large numbers of directories/files (more than 10000).
28Jan07 
kes  Fix maxruntime bug #621.
26Jan07
ebl  Implement the include JobID in spool file name project.
kes  Reorder projects file in order determined by Jan 2007 vote.
kes  Implement item #12 on project list -- quick release of FD by
     the SD.
kes  Fix open of SQLite3 db where user does not have write permission
     so that DIR does not crash. Fixes bug #761.
25Jan07
kes  Add back missing @ in Win32 Makefile.
kes  Change 'Device not configured to autolabel' from INFO
     to WARNING.
kes  Fix jobq.c to restart failed jobs when Reschedule Times = 0 
     which should restart an indefinite # of times.
kes  Fix configure --help to print --with-mysql[=DIR]. Same for
     other DIR specifications.
23Jan07
rn   Fix msvc build problems. Fix bacula.dll exports for msvc build.
     Fix path quoting in SQLite scripts.
     Fix problems with SHGetFolderPath.
19Jan07
kes  Create patches/2.0.1-restart.patch. Fixes bug #755.
18Jan07
kes  Fix Job restart on error bug that promotes an Inc to a Full
     backup.  This should fix bug #755.
kes  Add qt-console and first cut of code.

Version 2.0.1
12Jan07
kes  Fix Bacula->Documentation link on Win32 to point to index.html
     instead of bacula.html. Fixed bug #750.
kes  Return JobId in db_get_job_record() when JobId==0. This should
     fix bug #741.
kes  Do not release source pointers when restarting a failed job.
11Jan07
kes  Add dynamic dll entry point for SHGetFolderPath to Win32 code.
     This *should* fix bug #747.
kes  Modify winbacula.nsi to substitute with g bin_dir_cmd. Should fix
     bug #742.
09Jan07
kes  Modify USTORE constructor to set an empty store_source string, 
     and don't copy the store_source string in a cancel.  Hopefully
     this will fix Arno's seg fault, bug #744.
kes  Add back code to disable conio in configure. Fixes bug #743.
kes  Correct the Options scanner in the FD to correctly handle  
     SHA1 option, which was eating the next option.  Reported by    
     Sebastien Guilbaud.
kes  Add code to indicate when the SD is spooling, spool wait, and 
     despooling as requested by Alan Brown.

Version 2.0.0 released: 4 January 2007
