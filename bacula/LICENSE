Trademark:
The name Bacula is a registered trademark.

===================================

License:
For the most part, Bacula is licensed under the GPL version 2         
and any code that is Copyright Kern Sibbald and John Walker or
Copyright Kern Sibbald (after November 2004) with the GPL
indication is so licensed, but with the following five additions:

Linking: 
Bacula may be linked with any libraries permitted under the GPL,
or with any non-GPLed libraries, including OpenSSL, that are
required for its proper functioning, providing the source code of
those non-GPLed libraries is non-proprietary and freely
available to the public.

Termination for IP or Patent Action: 
In addition to the termination clause specified in the GPL, this
license shall terminate automatically and you may no longer
exercise any of the rights granted to you by this license as of
the date you commence an action, including a cross-claim or
counterclaim, against any licensor of GPL software alleging that
the software infringes an intellectual property right or a
patent.  Special dispensation from or delay to the execution of
this clause may be possible by applying directly to the license
owner of this software.  Such a dispensation or delay is valid
only in writing and signed by the one or more of the license
holders.

IP rights:
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
entity.  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise.  As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
intellectual property rights needed, if any.  For example, if a
third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
acquire that license before distributing the Program.

Copyrights:
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

Code falling under the above conditions will be marked as follows:

Windows:
Certain source code used to build the Windows version of the Bacula
File daemon is copyrighted and or trademarked by Microsoft and may
contain Microsoft intellectual property (examples: Microsoft VC++, the
source to the VSS libraries, the Microsoft C runtime libraries).  As
such we cannot and do not distribute that software. The compiler is
available for purchase, and Microsoft provides a free version of the
compiler. The source code and libraries are available for download from
Microsoft public Web servers.  We have documented in the src/win32
directory how we build the Windows File daemon and many users have
succeeded in doing so themselves.  Our intention is to respect as
closely as possible Open Source practices while maintaining full
respect for proprietary and copyrighted code.
