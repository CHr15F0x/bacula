  adequate support by the Bacula community.

Item 1:   Allow Jobdefs to inherit from other Jobdefs
   Origin: Darien Hager <darien@etelos.com>
   Date:   10 April 2007
   Status: Initial Request

   What:   Allow JobDefs to inherit/modify settings from other JobDefs

   Why:    Makes setting up jobs much easier for situations with many  
clients doing similar work

   Notes:

Example: User has several JobDefs which all need Messages=standard,  
Type=Backup, and settings for "Rerun Failed Levels" and "Max * Time".  
This feature would allow those "common" properties to be within a  
single JobDef which each child JobDefs inherits from, before the  
final Job definitions sets further specifics such as Client.

Currently the documentation leaves open the possibility that this can  
be done, but tests with Bacula 2.0.1 suggest that JobDefs entries  
cannot themselves have a JobDefs property.

Technical caveat: Should probably include rudimentary checks against  
a cyclic relationship, such as a limit to the number of allowed layers.
